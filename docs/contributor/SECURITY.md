# Security Policy

Parity Technologies is committed to resolving security vulnerabilities in our
software quickly and carefully. We take the necessary steps to minimize risk,
provide timely information, and deliver vulnerability fixes and mitigations
required to address security issues.

## Sourcing Security Information
The [Polkadot Security Hub](https://security.parity.io/) is a resource for all
things security in the Polkadot ecosystem. You can discover [Security
Vulnerabilities Disclosures](https://security.parity.io/disclosures), learn
in detail about
[Common Security Vulnerabilities](https://security.parity.io/top),
find information on
[how to securely test your Polkadot project](https://security.parity.io/tools),
what [audits](https://security.parity.io/audits) have been conducted, and how
to get involved in the security of Polkadot.

## Responsible Investigation and Reporting

Responsible investigation and reporting includes, but isn't limited to, the
following:

- Initially report the bug only to us and not to anyone else.
- Give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the bug before disclosing without
  authorization, as rewards are not paid before a fix as been created and
  deployed.
- Don’t make repeat submissions of low quality, rejected or automated
  vulnerability reports. You will put yourself at risk of being banned
  permanently.
- Don’t defraud or harm Parity Technologies or Polkadot or its users during
  your research; you should make a good faith effort to not interrupt or
  degrade our and the network's services. Investigate and report bugs
  in a way that makes a reasonable, good faith effort not to be disruptive or
  harmful to us or our users. Otherwise, your actions might be interpreted as
  an attack rather than an effort to be helpful.
- Don't target our physical security measures, or attempt to use social
  engineering, spam, distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks, etc.
- Don't violate the privacy of other users, destroy data, etc.

### Parity's Bug Bounty Program

Parity's Bug Bounty Program allows us to recognize and reward members of the
Polkadot ecosystem for helping us find and address significant bugs, in
accordance with the terms of the program. Submission to the program WILL only
be considered if it's done through the form link specified in the program
website.

A detailed description of scope, eligibility, rewards, legal information and
terms & conditions for contributors can be found on
[Parity's website](https://parity.io/bug-bounty).

### Polkadot <> Kusama Bridges Bug Bounty Program

Polkadot Bridges are a collection of components (Substrate pallets, crypto
libraries, consensus algorithms) connecting different blockchain systems, as
well as relayers to provide cross-chain communication capabilities. However,
their significance and high transaction volume makes them prime targets for
malicious attacks. Participate in this Bug Bounty Program sponsored by
Polkadot Treasury to help protect the vital connection between Polkadot and
other blockchains.

A detailed description of scope, eligibility, rewards, legal information and
terms & conditions for contributors can be found on
[Polkadot's website](https://polkadot.com/bridges-bug-bounty).
