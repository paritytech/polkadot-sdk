# Overview

Snowbridge provides a secure point-to-point bridge between the BridgeHub parachain and our Gateway contract on Ethereum.

Our bridge enables communication between any Polkadot parachain and Ethereum using Polkadot's XCMP messaging protocol. Specifically, parachains can send XCM instructions to BridgeHub to use the bridge.
