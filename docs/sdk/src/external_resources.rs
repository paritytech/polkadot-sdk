//! # External Resources
//!
//! A non-exhaustive, un-opinionated list of external resources about Polkadot SDK.
//!
//! Unlike [`crate::guides`], or [`crate::polkadot_sdk::templates`] that contain material directly
//! maintained in the `polkadot-sdk` repository, the list of resources here are maintained by
//! third-parties, and are therefore subject to more variability. Any further resources may be added
//! by opening a pull request to the `polkadot-sdk` repository.
