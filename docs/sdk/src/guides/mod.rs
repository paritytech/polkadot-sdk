//! # Polkadot SDK Docs Guides
//!
//! This crate contains a collection of guides that are foundational to the developers of Polkadot
//! SDK. They are common user-journeys that are traversed in the Polkadot ecosystem.
//!
//! 1. [`crate::guides::your_first_pallet`] is your starting point with Polkadot SDK. It contains
//!    the basics of
//! building a simple crypto currency with FRAME.
//! 2. [`crate::guides::your_first_runtime`] is the next step in your journey. It contains the
//!    basics of building a runtime that contains this pallet, plus a few common pallets from FRAME.
//!
//!
//! Other guides are related to other miscellaneous topics and are listed as modules below.

/// Write your first simple pallet, learning the most most basic features of FRAME along the way.

/// How to make a given runtime XCM-enabled, capable of sending messages (`Transact`) between itself
/// and the relay chain to which it is connected.
