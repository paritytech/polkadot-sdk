//! Chain spec and genesis build.
//!
//! # What is chain-spec.
//!
//! A chain specification file defines the set of properties that are required to run the node as
//! part of the chain. The chain specification consists of two main parts:
//! - initial state of the runtime,
//! - network / logical properties of the chain, the most important property being the list of
//!   bootnodes.
//!
//! This document describes how initial state is handled in pallets and runtime, and how to interact
//! with the runtime in order to build genesis state.
//!
//! For more information on chain specification and its properties, refer to
//! [`sc_chain_spec#from-initial-state-to-raw-genesis`].
//!
//! The initial genesis state can be provided in the following formats:
//!   - full
//!   - patch
//!   - raw
//!
//! Each of the formats is explained in [_chain-spec-format_][`sc_chain_spec#chain-spec-formats`].
//!
//!
//! ## `GenesisConfig` for `pallet`
//!
//! Every frame pallet may have its initial state which is defined by the `GenesisConfig` internal
//! struct. It is a regular rust struct, annotated with [`pallet::genesis_config`] attribute.
#![doc = docify::embed!("./src/reference_docs/chain_spec_runtime/src/pallets.rs", pallet_bar_GenesisConfig)]

//! The struct shall be defined within the pallet `mod`, as in the following code:
#![doc = docify::embed!("./src/reference_docs/chain_spec_runtime/src/pallets.rs", pallet_bar)]

//! The initial state conveyed in  the `GenesisConfig` struct is transformed into state storage
//! items by means of the [`BuildGenesisConfig`] trait which shall be implemented for the pallet's
//! `GenesisConfig` struct. The [`pallet::genesis_build`] attribute shall be attached to the `impl`
//! block:
#![doc = docify::embed!("./src/reference_docs/chain_spec_runtime/src/pallets.rs", pallet_bar_build)]

//! GenesisConfig may also contain more complicated types, including nested structs or enums, as in
//! the example for `pallet_foo`:
#![doc = docify::embed!("./src/reference_docs/chain_spec_runtime/src/pallets.rs", pallet_foo_GenesisConfig)]

//! Note that [`serde`] attributes can be used to control how the data
//! structures are being stored into JSON:
#![doc = docify::embed!("./src/reference_docs/chain_spec_runtime/src/pallets.rs", SomeFooData2)]

//! Please note that fields of `GenesisConfig` may not be directly mapped to storage items. In the
//! following example the initial struct fields are used to compute (sum) the value that will be
//! stored in state as `ProcessedEnumValue`:
#![doc = docify::embed!("./src/reference_docs/chain_spec_runtime/src/pallets.rs", pallet_foo_build)]

//! ## `GenesisConfig` for `runtimes`

//! The runtime genesis config struct consists of configs for every pallet. For [_demonstration
//! runtime_][`chain_spec_guide_runtime`] used in this guide, it consists of `SystemConfig`,
//! `BarConfig` and `FooConfig`. This structure was automatically generated by macro and it can be
//! sneak peaked here: [`RuntimeGenesisConfig`]. For further reading on generated runtime
//! types refer to [`frame_runtime_types`].
//!
//! Runtime exposes a dedicated runtime API for interacting with its genesis config:
//! [`sp_genesis_builder::GenesisBuilder`]. Implementation shall be provided within
//! [`sp_api::impl_runtime_apis`] macro, typically making use of some helpers provided:
//! [`build_state`], [`get_preset`].
//! A typical implementation of [`sp_genesis_builder::GenesisBuilder`] looks as follows:
#![doc = docify::embed!("./src/reference_docs/chain_spec_runtime/src/runtime.rs", runtime_impl)]

//! Please note that two functions are customized: `preset_names` and `get_preset`. The first one
//! just provides a `Vec` of names of supported presets, while the latter one delegates the call to
//! a function that maps the name to a preset:
//! [`chain_spec_guide_runtime::presets::get_builtin_preset`]
#![doc = docify::embed!("./src/reference_docs/chain_spec_runtime/src/presets.rs", get_builtin_preset)]

//! ## `Default` for `GenesisConfig`
//! `GenesisConfig` of all pallets must implement `Defualt` trait. Those are aggregated into
//! runtime's `RuntimeGenesisConfig`'s `Default`.
//!
//! Default value of `RuntimeGenesisConfig` can be queried by [`get_preset`] function of
//! `GenesisBuilder` with `id:None`.
//!
//! A default value for RuntimeGenesisConfig usually is not operable. This is because for some
//! pallets it is not possible to define good defaults (e.g. initial set of authorities).
//!
//! A default value is a base upon which a patch for `GenesisConfig` is applied. A good description
//! of how it exactly works is provided in
//! [`get_storage_for_patch`]. A patch can be
//! provided as a external file (manually created) or as builtin runtime preset.

//! ## Genesis state presets for `runtime`

//! The runtime may provide many flavors of initial genesis state. This may be useful for predefined
//! testing networks, local development, or CI integration tests. Predefined genesis state may
//! contain a list of pre-funded accounts, predefined authorities for consensus, sudo key and many
//! others useful for testing.

//! Internally presets can be provided in a number of ways:
//! - JSON in string form:
#![doc = docify::embed!("./src/reference_docs/chain_spec_runtime/src/presets.rs", preset_1)]
//! - JSON using runtime types to serialize values:
#![doc = docify::embed!("./src/reference_docs/chain_spec_runtime/src/presets.rs", preset_2)]
#![doc = docify::embed!("./src/reference_docs/chain_spec_runtime/src/presets.rs", preset_3)]
//! It is worth noting that preset does not have to be the full `RuntimeGenesisConfig`, in that
//! sense that it does not have to contain all the keys of the struct. The preset is actually a JSON
//! patch that will be merged with default value of `RuntimeGenesisConfig`. This approach should
//! simplify maintanance of builtin presets. Following example illustrates runtime genesis config
//! patch:
#![doc = docify::embed!("./src/reference_docs/chain_spec_runtime/src/presets.rs", preset_4)]

//! # Interacting with the tool
//!
//! The [`chain_spec_builder`] util allows to interact with runtime in order to list or display
//! presets and build the chain specification file. It is possible to use the tool with the
//! [_demonstration runtime_][`chain_spec_guide_runtime`]. To build required packages just run the
//! following command:
//! ```ignore
//! cargo build -p staging-chain-spec-builder -p chain-spec-guide-runtime --release
//! ```
//! The `chain-spec-builder` util can also be installed with `cargo install`:
//! ```ignore
//! cargo install staging-chain-spec-builder
//! cargo build -p chain-spec-guide-runtime --release
//! ```
//! Here are some examples in the form of rust tests:
//! ### Listing available presets names:
#![doc = docify::embed!("./src/reference_docs/chain_spec_runtime/tests/chain_spec_builder_tests.rs", list_presets)]
//! ### Displaying preset with given name
#![doc = docify::embed!("./src/reference_docs/chain_spec_runtime/tests/chain_spec_builder_tests.rs", get_preset)]
//! ### Building chain-spec using given preset
#![doc = docify::embed!("./src/reference_docs/chain_spec_runtime/tests/chain_spec_builder_tests.rs", generate_chain_spec)]
