# This script checks that crates to not carelessly enable features that
# should stay disabled. It's important to check that since features
# are used to gate specific functionality which should only be enabled
# when the feature is explicitly enabled.
#
# Invocation scheme:
# 	./rust-features.sh <CARGO-ROOT-PATH>
#
# Example:
# 	./rust-features.sh path/to/substrate
#
# The steps of this script:
#   1. Check that all required dependencies are installed.
#   2. Check that all rules are fullfilled for the whole workspace. If not:
#   4. Check all crates to find the offending ones.
#   5. Print all offending crates and exit with code 1.
