# Runtime

ℹ️ The runtime (in other words, a state transition function), refers to the core logic of the parachain that is
responsible for validating blocks and executing the state changes they define.

💁 The runtime in this template is constructed using ready-made FRAME pallets that ship with
[Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk), and a [template for a custom pallet](../pallets/README.md).
