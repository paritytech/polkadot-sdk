> This is a template for creating a [parachain](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parachains) based on Polkadot SDK.

* ⏫ This template provides a starting point to build a [parachain](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parachains).

* ☁️ It is based on the
[Cumulus](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/cumulus/index.html) framework.

* 🔧 Its runtime is configured of a single custom pallet as a starting point, and a handful of ready-made pallets
such as a [Balances pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_balances/index.html).

* 👉 Learn more about parachains [here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parachains)

## Template Structure

A Polkadot SDK based project such as this one consists of:

* 💿 a [Node](./node/README.md) - the binary application.
* 🧮 the [Runtime](./runtime/README.md) - the core logic of the parachain.
* 🎨 the [Pallets](./pallets/README.md) - from which the runtime is constructed.

## Getting Started

* 🦀 The template is using the Rust language.

* 👉 Check the
[Rust installation instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for your system.

* 🛠️ Depending on your operating system and Rust version, there might be additional
packages required to compile this template - please take note of the Rust compiler output.

### Build

🔨 Use the following command to build the node without launching it:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

🐳 Alternatively, build the docker image:

```sh
docker build . -t polkadot-sdk-parachain-template
```

### Local Development Chain

🧟 This project uses [Zombienet](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet) to orchestrate the relaychain and parachain nodes.
You can grab a [released binary](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases/latest) or use an [npm version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zombienet/cli).

This template produces a parachain node.
You still need a relaychain node - you can download the `polkadot`
(and the accompanying `polkadot-prepare-worker` and `polkadot-execute-worker`)
binaries from [Polkadot SDK releases](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/releases/latest).

Make sure to bring the parachain node - as well as `polkadot`, `polkadot-prepare-worker`, `polkadot-execute-worker`,
and `zombienet` - into `PATH` like so:

```sh
export PATH="./target/release/:$PATH"
```

This way, we can conveniently use them un the following steps.

👥 The following command starts a local development chain, with a single relay chain node and a single parachain collator:

```sh
zombienet --provider native spawn ./zombienet.toml

# Alternatively, the npm version:
npx --yes @zombienet/cli --provider native spawn ./zombienet.toml
```

Development chains:

* 🧹 Do not persist the state.
* 💰 Are preconfigured with a genesis state that includes several prefunded development accounts.
* 🧑‍⚖️ Development accounts are used as validators, collators, and `sudo` accounts.

### Connect with the Polkadot-JS Apps Front-End

* 🌐 You can interact with your local node using the
hosted version of the Polkadot/Substrate Portal:
[relay chain](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer?rpc=ws://localhost:9944)
and [parachain](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer?rpc=ws://localhost:9988).

* 🪐 A hosted version is also
available on [IPFS](https://dotapps.io/).

* 🧑‍🔧 You can also find the source code and instructions for hosting your own instance in the
[`polkadot-js/apps`](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps) repository.
