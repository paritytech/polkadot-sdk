# Node

A blockchain node is an application that allows users to participate in a
blockchain network. Substrate-based blockchain nodes expose a number of
capabilities:

- Networking: Substrate nodes use the [`libp2p`](https://libp2p.io/) networking
  stack to allow the nodes in the network to communicate with one another.
- Consensus: Blockchains must have a way to come to
  [consensus](https://docs.substrate.io/fundamentals/consensus/) on the state of
  the network. Substrate makes it possible to supply custom consensus engines
  and also ships with several consensus mechanisms that have been built on top
  of [Web3 Foundation
  research](https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/NPoS/index.html).
- RPC Server: A remote procedure call (RPC) server is used to interact with
  Substrate nodes.

There are several files in the `node` directory. Take special note of the
following:

- [`chain_spec.rs`](./src/chain_spec.rs): A [chain
  specification](https://docs.substrate.io/build/chain-spec/) is a source code
  file that defines a Substrate chain's initial (genesis) state. Chain
  specifications are useful for development and testing, and critical when
  architecting the launch of a production chain. Take note of the
  `development_config` and `testnet_genesis` functions. These functions are
  used to define the genesis state for the local development chain
  configuration. These functions identify some [well-known
  accounts](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/command-line-tools/subkey/) and
  use them to configure the blockchain's initial state.
- [`service.rs`](./src/service.rs): This file defines the node
  implementation. Take note of the libraries that this file imports and the
  names of the functions it invokes. In particular, there are references to
  consensus-related topics, such as the [block finalization and
  forks](https://docs.substrate.io/fundamentals/consensus/#finalization-and-forks)
  and other [consensus
  mechanisms](https://docs.substrate.io/fundamentals/consensus/#default-consensus-models)
  such as Aura for block authoring and GRANDPA for finality.
