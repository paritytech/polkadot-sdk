## Getting Started

Depending on your operating system and Rust version, there might be additional
packages required to compile this template.

Check the
[Substrate Install](https://docs.substrate.io/install/) instructions for your platform for
the most common dependencies.

### Build

Use the following command to build the node without launching it:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

Alternatively, build the docker image:

```sh
docker build . -t polkadot-sdk-minimal-template
```

### Single-Node Development Chain

The following command starts a single-node development chain that doesn't
persist state:

```sh
./target/release/minimal-template-node --dev

# docker version:
docker run --rm polkadot-sdk-minimal-template --dev
```

Development chains:

- Maintain state in a `tmp` folder while the node is running.
- Are preconfigured with a genesis state (see [`chain_spec.rs`](./node/src/chain_spec.rs)) that
  includes several prefunded development accounts.
- Development accounts are used as default validator authorities and a `sudo` account.

### Multi-Node Local Testnet

If you want to see the multi-node consensus algorithm in action, see [Simulate a
network](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/build-a-blockchain/simulate-network/).

### Connect with the Polkadot-JS Apps Front-End

After you start the node template locally, you can interact with it using the
hosted version of the [Polkadot/Substrate
Portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer?rpc=ws://localhost:9944)
front-end by connecting to the local node endpoint. A hosted version is also
available on [IPFS (redirect) here](https://dotapps.io/) or [IPNS (direct)
here](ipns://dotapps.io/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944#/explorer). You can
also find the source code and instructions for hosting your own instance on the
[`polkadot-js/apps`](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps) repository.

## Template Structure

A Polkadot SDK based project such as this one consists of:

- a [Node](./node/README.md) - the binary application.
- the [Runtime](./runtime/README.md) - the core logic of the blockchain.
- the [Pallets](./pallets/README.md) - from which the runtime is constructed.
