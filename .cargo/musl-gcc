# Wrapper for building with musl.
#
# musl unfortunately requires a musl-enabled C compiler (musl-gcc) to be
# installed, which can be kind of a pain to get installed depending on the
# distro. That's not a very good user experience.
#
# The real musl-gcc wrapper sets the correct system include paths for linking
# with musl libc library. Since this is not actually used to link any binaries
# it should most likely work just fine.
