    Polkadot-SDK uses the Zepter CLI to detect abnormalities in the feature configuration.
    It looks like one more more checks failed; please check the console output. You can try to automatically address them by running `zepter`.
    Otherwise please ask directly in the Merge Request, GitHub Discussions or on Matrix Chat, thank you.
