title: Charge deposit based on key length
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: We were only charging storage deposit based on value length but not
    based on key length. Since we allow for variable length keys this has to be done.
    Needs to be back ported since changing this in an already deployed system will
    be nasty.
