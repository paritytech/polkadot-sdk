      This PR makes the litep2p backend the default network backend in Kusama.
      We performed a gradual rollout in Kusama by asking validators to manually switch to litep2p.
      The rollout went smoothly, with 250 validators running litep2p without issues. This PR represents the next step in testing the backend at scale.
