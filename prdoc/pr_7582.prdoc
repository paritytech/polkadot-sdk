title: Implementation of `ah-client` and `rc-client` staking pallets
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    This PR introduces the initial structure for `pallet-ah-client` and `pallet-rc-client`. These
    pallets will reside on the relay chain and AssetHub, respectively, and will manage the interaction
    between `pallet-session` on the relay chain and `pallet-staking` on AssetHub.
    Both pallets are experimental and not intended for production use.
