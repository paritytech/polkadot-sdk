    description: |
      Fixes a memory leak which caused the Jaeger span storage in availability-distribution to never be pruned and therefore increasing indefinitely.
      This was caused by improper handling of finalized heads. More info in https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/5258
