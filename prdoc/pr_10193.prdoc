    Fixes https://github.com/paritytech/contract-issues/issues/182

    Add support for EVM bytecode to the upload_code extrinsic.
    Tests in issue https://github.com/paritytech/contract-issues/issues/182 send hardhat_setCode, which uses revive's upload_code API; this change makes that flow accept and store the EVM bytecode using upload_code extrinsic.
