title: '[pallet-revive] implement the gas price API'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: This PR implements the EVM gas price syscall API method. Currently
    this is a compile time constant in revive, but in the EVM it is an opcode. Thus
    we should provide an opcode for this in the pallet.
