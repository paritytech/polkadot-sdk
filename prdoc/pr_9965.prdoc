title: Limit the size of the statement for further gossiping
doc:
- audience: Node Dev
  description: "Limits the size of statements that are further gossiped over the network to prevent skipping oversized messages. The limit is set to match the network protocol's `MAX_STATEMENT_SIZE` (256 KB), accounting for 1-byte vector length overhead because statements are sent as `Vec<Statement>`."
