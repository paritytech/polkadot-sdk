title: 'Fix implication order in implementation of `TransactionExtension` for tuple'
doc:
- audience:
  - Runtime Dev
  - Runtime User
  description: |-
    Before this PR, the implications were different in the pipeline `(A, B, C)` and `((A, B), C)`.
    This PR fixes this behavior and make nested tuple transparant, the implication order of tuple of
    tuple is now the same as in a single tuple.

    For runtime users this mean that the implication can be breaking depending on the pipeline used
    in the runtime.

    For runtime developers this breaks usage of `TransactionExtension::validate`.
    When calling `TransactionExtension::validate` the implication must now implement `Implication`
    trait, you can use `TxBaseImplication` to wrap the type and use it as the base implication.
    E.g. instead of `&(extension_version, call),` you can write `&TxBaseImplication((extension_version, call))`.
