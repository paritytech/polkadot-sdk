    When warp syncing a node using the equivocation checking verifier, we now properly set the fork_choice rule.
    Affected are mostly nodes that are derived from the parachain template. Omni-node is not affected.

    The prevents the error `ClientImport("Incomplete block import pipeline.")` after state sync.
