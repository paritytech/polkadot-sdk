title: 'XCMP: use batching when enqueuing inbound messages'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    This PR implements batching for the XCMP inbound enqueueing logic, which leads to an about ~75x performance
    improvement for that specific code.

    The PR also moves the `footprint()` method from the `EnqueuMessage` trait to a new `QueueuFootprintQuery` trait.
