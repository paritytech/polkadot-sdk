title: "Adapt core-fellowship and salary pallets for swapped members"

doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      The ranked-collective pallet got the ability to swap members but the core-fellowship and
      salary pallets would not be notified of this change. This MR adds `MemberSwappedHandler` to
      the collective that is implemented by both pallets.
