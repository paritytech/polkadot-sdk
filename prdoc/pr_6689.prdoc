title: '[pallet-revive] Update gas encoding'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    Update the current approach to attach the `ref_time`, `pov` and `deposit` parameters to an Ethereum transaction.
Previously, these three parameters were passed along with the signed payload, and the fees resulting from gas Ã— gas_price were checked to ensure they matched the actual fees paid by the user for the extrinsic

    This approach unfortunately can be attacked. A malicious actor could force such a transaction to fail by injecting low values for some of these extra parameters as they are not part of the signed payload.

    The new approach encodes these 3 extra parameters in the lower digits of the transaction gas, using the log2 of the actual values to  encode each components on 2 digits
