title: 'Statement-store: Propagate all statements to newly connected peers'
doc:
- audience: Node Dev
  description: |
    When a new node connects, we now propagate all statements in our store to them. This happens in bursts of ~1MiB messages
    over time to not completley use up all resources. If multiple peers are connecting, round robin between them.
