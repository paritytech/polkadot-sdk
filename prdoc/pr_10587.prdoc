title: Derive extra traits for fungibles::Imbalance
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    This PR adds the same derived traits to `fungibles::Imbalance` that are already derived for `fungible::Imbalance`.

    This is required so that the `OnChargeTransaction` configuration of `pallet_transaction_payment` can work for the `fungibles` version of types/traits (it already works for `fungible`).
