      description: "Messages from the DMP dispatch queue will be moved over to the MQ pallet via `on_initialize`. This happens over multiple blocks and emits a `Completed` event at the end. The pallet can be un-deployed and deleted afterwards. Note that the migration reverses the order of messages, which should be acceptable as a one-off."
