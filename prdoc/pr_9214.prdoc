title: Enable proof recording in trace_block
doc:
  - audience: Node Dev
    description: |
      The RPC method `state_traceBlock` never enables proof recording, which causes it to fail on any substrate chain that uses `StorageWeightReclaim` with a storage root mismatch error.

      This PR enables proof recording in `trace_block`. This change is transparent to users and requires no configuration changes.
