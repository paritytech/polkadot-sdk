title: 'Bounded Slashing: Paginated Offence Processing & Slash Application'

doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      This PR refactors the slashing mechanism in `pallet-staking` to be bounded by introducing paged offence processing and paged slash application.

            ### Key Changes
            - Offences are queued instead of being processed immediately.
            - Slashes are computed in pages, stored as a `StorageDoubleMap` with `(Validator, SlashFraction, PageIndex)` to uniquely identify them.
            - Slashes are applied incrementally across multiple blocks instead of a single unbounded operation.
            - New storage items: `OffenceQueue`, `ProcessingOffence`, `OffenceQueueEras`.
            - Updated API for cancelling and applying slashes.
            - Preliminary benchmarks added; further optimizations planned.

            This enables staking slashing to scale efficiently and removes a major blocker for staking migration to a parachain (AH).
