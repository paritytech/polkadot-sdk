title: 'Fix `claim_rewards_to` benchmark to enable Snowbridge reward claims'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    The `prepare_rewards_account` benchmark helper was returning `None`, causing `claim_rewards_to`
    to be assigned `Weight::MAX` and effectively disabling the extrinsic in production. This fix
    returns a valid beneficiary account, enabling Snowbridge relayers to claim rewards to AssetHub
    as intended.
