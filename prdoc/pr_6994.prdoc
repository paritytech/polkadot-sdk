    description: |
      the PF pallet handles the Optimistic Project Funding. 
      It allows users to nominate projects (whitelisted in OpenGov) with their DOT. 
      This mechanism will be funded with a constant stream of DOT taken directly from inflation and distributed to projects based on the proportion of DOT that has nominated them.
