title: BEEFY on Polkadot

doc:
  - audience: Node Operator
    description: |
      The BEEFY gadget has been enabled on Polkadot by default.
      If experiencing stability issues caused by BEEFY, it can be disabled using `--no-beefy` flag.
      BEEFY doesn't (yet) support warp sync. So, attempting to Warp sync as a validator will throw an error.
