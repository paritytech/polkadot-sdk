  description: |-
    This PR changes the Rust documentation of some extrinsic calls in the scheduler pallet.

    It also adds some checks to the `Lookup<T>` storage item in a unit test to named task cancellation via
    the anonymous cancellation call, and a unit test for the rescheduling of a failed named/anonymous task
    to a full agenda.
