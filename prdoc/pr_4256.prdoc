title: "Bridges: Making relayer compatible with runtime upgrades"

doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      Bridge pallets are extended with compatible relayer version constants.
      This constant "seals" all bridge settings that may affect running relayer.
      Once it changes, a new relayer version needs to be deployed. On the other
      hand, we may keep running the same relayer over multiple runtime upgrades
      if relayer version stays the same.
