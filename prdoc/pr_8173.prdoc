title: expose current advertised xcm version
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: Right now there is no "easy" way of knowing what is the currently supported
    xcm version without looking at the code or the metadata. Since pallet-xcm already
    has a constant to detect the latest advertised version, there is no reason (I
    think) to not expose it as a constant
crates:
- name: pallet-xcm
  bump: patch
