title: "Parachains-Aura: Only produce once per slot"

doc:
  - audience: Node Dev
    description: |
      With the introduction of asynchronous backing the relay chain allows parachain to include blocks every 6 seconds.
      The Cumulus Aura implementations, besides the lookahead collator, are building blocks when there is a free slot for
      the parachain in the relay chain. Most parachains are still running with a 12s slot duration and not allowing
      to build multiple blocks per slot. But, the block production logic will be triggered every 6s, resulting in error
      logs like: "no space left for the block in the unincluded segment". This is solved by ensuring that we don't build
      multiple blocks per slot.
