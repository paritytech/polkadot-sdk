doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: Adds `nth_migrating_prefixes` method to `SteppedMigrations` trait to expose storage prefixes
      that will be modified by each migration. This enables external tooling to inspect which
      storage areas will be affected by migrations before execution.
