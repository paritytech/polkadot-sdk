title: "Adds example for custom default configs"

    description: |
      This PR provides an example to create custom default configs for any pallet that could be
      created externally and shared across runtimes.

      It requires the following:
      1. A trait that carries those configuration parameters for a pallet that should be shared
      2. An implementation of that trait registered via `register_default_impl`
      3. Usage of `derive_impl` at the actual impl site pointing to this default implementation
