title: Move Transaction depth limit checks
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |
    This moves the check of the transaction depth limit to `frame-executive`
    instead of having it hidden in the `sp-api` macros.

    If you have used `MAX_EXTRINSIC_DEPTH` from the `sp-api` crate, the constant was moved to `frame-support`:
    ```diff
    -sp_api::MAX_EXTRINSIC_DEPTH
    +frame_support::MAX_EXTRINSIC_DEPTH
    ```
