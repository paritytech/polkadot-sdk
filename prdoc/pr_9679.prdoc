title: '[pallet-revive] fix GAS_PRICE'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    Currently submitting a transaction to the dev-node or kitchensink will trigger an error when you try to submit a transaction trough cast (or anything using alloy) as the block gas limit on these runtime is greater than u64::max.

    This bumps the GAS_PRICE to fix this issue, this will eventually be superseeded by the new gas model
