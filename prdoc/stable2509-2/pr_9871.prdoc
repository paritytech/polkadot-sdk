title: '`trace_block`: Support overwriting `execute_block`'
doc:
- audience: Node Dev
  description: |-
    This is required for example for parachains that require special extensions to be registered (e.g. `ProofSizeExt`) to succeed the block execution.
    The node will make a best effort to detect whether its a parachain or not.
