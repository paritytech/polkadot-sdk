title: 'pallet-support: add source of payment to Pay trait'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: | 
    Adds a `Source` type to the `Pay` trait, introducing a new `source` field in its methods.
    This change enables scenarios where defining the payment source is necessary.
    It sets the stage for enabling multi-asset and cross-chain bounties in upcoming work.

    Updates pallets using the trait by assigning the unit type, given that the field is currently unused.
