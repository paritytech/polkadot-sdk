title: "Contracts: Add XCM traits to interface with contracts"

doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      We are introducing a new set of `XcmController` traits in `pallet-xcm`.
      These traits extract functionality from `pallet-xcm` and provide high-level interaction with XCM.
      They enable other pallets, like `pallet_contracts`, to rely on these traits instead of tight coupling to `pallet-xcm` itself.

crates:
  - name: pallet-xcm
  - name: xcm-executor
