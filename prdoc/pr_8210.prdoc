title: '[xcm-builder][origin_conversion] LocationAsSuperuser converter introduced'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    Introduces a `LocationAsSuperuser` struct that implements `ConvertOrigin` to allow specific `Location`s defined through XCM configuration to act as Root on the local chain. Implementation is generic over `Location` but was created for purposes of allowing AssetHub system chain (by other system chains and relay chains) to execute Root level extrinsics like `authorize_upgrade` on them.
