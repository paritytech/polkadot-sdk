title: "Added Trusted Query API calls."

  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      Added is_trusted_reserve and is_trusted_teleporter API calls to all the runtimes.
      Given an asset and a location, they return if the chain trusts that location as a reserve or teleporter for that asset respectively.
      You can implement them on your runtime by simply calling a helper function on `pallet-xcm`.
      ```rust
      	impl xcm_runtime_apis::trusted_query::TrustedQueryApi<Block> for Runtime {
        fn is_trusted_reserve(asset: VersionedAsset, location: VersionedLocation) -> Result<bool, xcm_runtime_apis::trusted_query::Error> {
          PolkadotXcm::is_trusted_reserve(asset, location)
        }
        fn is_trusted_teleporter(asset: VersionedAsset, location: VersionedLocation) -> Result<bool, xcm_runtime_apis::trusted_query::Error> {
          PolkadotXcm::is_trusted_teleporter(asset, location)
        }
      }
      ```

      There's a new runtime API to check if a chain trust a Location as a reserve or teleporter for a given Asset.
      It's implemented in all the relays and system parachains in Westend and Rococo.
