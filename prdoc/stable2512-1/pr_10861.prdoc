title: '[pallet-revive] weight charge in `sr25519_verify` and `ecdsa_to_eth_address`
  precompiles'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: I couldn't see where the weight is charged in those builtin pre-compiles
    and a quick test indicated that there's no charges implemented. Assuming those
    are compute-heavy functions, the missing weight charges seem like a DoS vector.
