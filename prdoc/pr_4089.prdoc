title: "pallet_broker: Support renewing leases expired in a previous period"

doc:
  - audience: Runtime User
    description: |
      Allow renewals of leases that ended before `start_sales` or in the first period after calling `start_sales`.
      This ensures that everyone has a smooth experience when migrating to coretime and the timing of
      `start_sales` isn't that important.
