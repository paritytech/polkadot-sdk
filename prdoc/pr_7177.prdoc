title: Make frame crate not experimental
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    We already use it for lots of pallet.

    Keeping it feature gated by experimental means we lose the information of which pallet was using experimental before the migration to frame crate usage.

    I think we should rather just consider `frame` crate not experimental.
