title: Fix utility::force_batch returning incorrect weights causing mismatch
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    The returned weights from the `pallet_utility::force_batch` dispatch was using `batch` weights instead of the `force_batch` weight causing a invalid weight being returned. Now it returns the correct weight.
