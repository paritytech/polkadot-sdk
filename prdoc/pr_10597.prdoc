title: 'Introduce pallet-dap-satellite for system chain fund collection and redirect all burns for native tokens to DAP/DAP satellite on Westend runtimes'

  description: |-
    This PR introduces pallet-dap-satellite, allowing system chains different from AssetHub
    to collect funds (to be periodically sent to DAP on AssetHub in future PRs) instead of
    burning them directly.

    **Changes:**

    - **pallet-dap-satellite**: New pallet that implements `BurnHandler` and `OnUnbalanced`
      by accumulating funds in a satellite account.

    - **[breaking change] pallet-balances**: `BurnDestination` is now a required config item
      that must implement `BurnHandler`. The `BurnHandler::on_burned` method is called after
      `decrease_balance` removes funds from an account, allowing each runtime to choose whether
      burns lead to direct burning (reducing total issuance) or redirecting to a buffer.
      Runtimes must explicitly configure this:
      - Non-DAP runtimes should use `pallet_balances::DirectBurn<Balances, AccountId>`
      - DAP-integrated runtimes use `pallet_dap::Pallet<Runtime>` (on AssetHub) or
        `pallet_dap_satellite::Pallet<Runtime>` (on other system chains)
      Note that non-native asset burns via pallet-assets do not use pallet-balances's implementation
      of BurnHandler but they rely on the default one: each asset in pallet-assets has its own supply
      that should decrease when burned.

    - **frame-support**: New `BurnHandler` trait and `DirectBurn` struct. `DirectBurn` implements
      `BurnHandler::on_burned` to reduce total issuance.

    - Redirect all burns to DAP or DAP satellite.
