      This PR adds the XCM precompile (with `xcmSend`, `xcmExecute` and `weighMessage` functionalities) to `pallet-xcm`.

      This follows the discussion we had on a closed PR, which attempted to add the precompile to `pallet-revive`, but that approach would have introduced unwanted cyclic dependencies. That's why we decided to migrate the precompile to `pallet-xcm`, avoiding adding unnecessary dependencies to `pallet-revive`.

      Follow up PR will add integration tests under `cumulus/parachains/integration-tests/emulated/tests`.
