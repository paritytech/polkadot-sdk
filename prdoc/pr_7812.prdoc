title: '`apply_authorized_upgrade`: Remote authorization if the version check fails'
doc:
- audience: Runtime User
  description: |-
    This pr ensures that we remove the authorization for a runtime upgrade if the version check failed. 
    If that check is failing, it means that the runtime upgrade is invalid and the check will never succeed.

    Besides that the pr is doing some clean ups.
