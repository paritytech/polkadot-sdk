doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
        Assets pallet includes pallet-revive precompiles and subsequently pull a lot of EVM related dependencies by default. This change
        hides the precompiles behind a feature flag `precompiles`, so downstream users can opt-in to the precompiles if they need them.
