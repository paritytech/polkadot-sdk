title: Limit the number of signals per XCMP page
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    Right now we have only 2 XCMP signals: `SuspendChannel` and `ResumeChannel` and we can write at most 1 per page.

    Let's also add a limit when reading the signals in a page. Even if now 1 is enough, since in the future we might add more signals, let's have a limit of 3 per page.
