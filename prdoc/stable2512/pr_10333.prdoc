title: 'parachain-consensus: Do not pin blocks on the relay chain during syncing'

- audience: Node Operator
  description: |-
    The parachain-consensus component in parachain nodes was hogging finality notifications. This is now fixed. 
    The finality notifications where keeping blocks pinned in memory, causing unnecessary memory usage.
