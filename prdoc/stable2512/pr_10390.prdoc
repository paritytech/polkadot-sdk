title: 'UncheckedExtrinsic: Ensure that encoding leads to same bytes an ext was decoded
  from'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    This pull request ensures that when decoding an `UncheckedExtrinsic` from a certain byte string, it also encodes to the same byte string. This is achieved by keeping the original bytes used to decode the `call` around and then directly encode these.
