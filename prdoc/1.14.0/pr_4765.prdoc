title: CheckWeight - account for extrinsic len as proof size

doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      This changes how CheckWeight extension works. It will now account for the extrinsic length
      as proof size. When `on_idle` is called, the remaining weight parameter reflects this.
