title: Use relay chain slot for velocity measurement on parachains

doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      The AuraExt pallets `ConsensusHook` is performing checks based on a parachains velocity. It was previously
      checking how many blocks where produced in a given parachain slot. This only works well when the parachain
      and relay chain slot length is the same. After this PR, we are checking against the relay chain slot.

      **ðŸš¨ Action Required:** A migration of name `cumulus_pallet_aura_ext::migration::MigrateV0ToV1` is included
      that cleans up a renamed storage item. Parachain must add it to their runtimes. More information is available in
      the [reference docs](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/reference_docs/frame_runtime_upgrades_and_migrations/index.html#single-block-migrations).
