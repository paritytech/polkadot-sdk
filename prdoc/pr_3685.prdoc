title: FRAME Reintroduce `TransactionExtension` as a replacement for `SignedExtension`

doc:
  - audience: [Runtime Dev, Runtime User, Node Operator, Node Dev]
    description: |
      Introduces a new trait `TransactionExtension` to replace `SignedExtension`. Introduce the
      idea of transactions which obey the runtime's extensions and have according Extension data
      (n√© Extra data) yet do not have hard-coded signatures.

      Deprecate the terminology of "Unsigned" when used for transactions/extrinsics owing to there
      now being "proper" unsigned transactions which obey the extension framework and "old-style"
      unsigned which do not. Instead we have `General` for the former and `Bare` for the latter.
      Unsigned will be phased out as a type of transaction, and `Bare` will only be used for
      Inherents.

      Types of extrinsic are now therefore
        - Bare (no hardcoded signature, no Extra data; used to be known as "Unsigned")
            - Bare transactions (deprecated) - Gossiped, validated with `ValidateUnsigned`
              (deprecated) and the `_bare_compat` bits of `TransactionExtension` (deprecated).
            - Inherents - Not gossiped, validated with `ProvideInherent`.
        - Extended (Extra data) - Gossiped, validated via `TransactionExtension`.
            - Signed transactions (with a hardcoded signature).
            - General transactions (without a hardcoded signature).

      Notable information on `TransactionExtension` and the differences from `SignedExtension`
        - `AdditionalSigned`/`additional_signed` is renamed to `Implicit`/`implicit`. It is encoded
          for the entire transaction and passed in to each extension as a new argument to validate.
        - `pre_dispatch` is renamed to `prepare`.
        - `validate` runs transaction validation logic both off-chain and on-chain, and is
          non-mutating.
        - `prepare` runs on-chain pre-execution logic using information extracted during validation
          and is mutating.
        - `validate` and `prepare` are now passed an `Origin` rather than an `AccountId`. If the
          extension logic presumes an `AccountId`, consider using the trait function
          `AsSystemOriginSigner::as_system_origin_signer`.
        - A signature on the underlying transaction may validly not be present.
        - The origin may be altered during validation.
        - Validation functionality present in `validate` should not be repeated in `prepare`.
          Useful information obtained during `validate` should now be passed in to `prepare` using
          the new user-specifiable type `Val`.
        - Unsigned logic should be temporarily migrated from the old `*_unsigned` functions into the
          regular versions of the new functions where the `Origin` is `None`, until the deprecation
          of `ValidateUnsigned` in phase 2 of Extrinsic Horizon.
        - The `Call` type defining the runtime call is now a type parameter.
        - Extensions now track the weight they consume during validation, preparation and
          post-dispatch through the `TransactionExtensionBase::weight` function.
        - `TestXt` was removed and its usage in tests was replaced with `UncheckedExtrinsic`
          instances.

      To fix the build issues introduced by this change, use the `AsTransactionExtension` adapter
      to wrap existing `SignedExtension`s by converting them using the `From<SignedExtension>`
      generic implementation for `AsTransactionExtension`. More details on migrating existing
      `SignedExtension` implementations to `TransactionExtension` in the PR description.
