title: Add deposit for setting session keys
doc:
- audience: [Runtime Dev, Runtime User]
  description: |-
    Setting session keys might put some funds on hold in the future, depending on how runtimes use this feature.

    Requires `pallet_session::Config` to specify:
    * `type Currency`, assigned to an instance of `pallet_balances`.
    * `type RuntimeHoldReason`, almost always set to `RuntimeHoldReason`.
    * `type KeyDeposit`, the amount of deposit. Set to `()` to assert no deposit amount is needed.
