doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    Implement hold balance tracking for test accounts in the session pallet.

    Requires `pallet_session::Config` to specify:
    * `type Currency`, assigned to an instance of `pallet_balances`.
    * `type RuntimeHoldReason`, almost always set to `RuntimeHoldReason`.
    * `type KeyDeposit`, the amount of deposit. Set to `()` to assert to deposit amount is needed.
