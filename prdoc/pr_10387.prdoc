title: "pallet-revive: add DebugSetting for bypassing eip-3607 for contracts"
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    Adds a new DebugSetting option which, if enabled, allows transactions coming from contract accounts.
    This is needed so that test nodes like anvil can send transactions from
    contract accounts, a widely-used feature in tests.
    Only works for contract accounts, not precompiles.
