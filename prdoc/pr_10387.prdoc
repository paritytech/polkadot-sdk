title: "pallet-revive: add DebugSetting for bypassing eip-3607 for contracts and precompiles"
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    Adds a new DebugSetting option which, if enabled, allows transactions coming from contract accounts or precompiles.
    This is needed so that test nodes like anvil can send transactions from
    contract or precompile accounts, a widely-used feature in tests.
