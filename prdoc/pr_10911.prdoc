title: '[pallet-revive] Fix EXTCODESIZE and EXTCODEHASH for mocked addresses'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: Fixes EXTCODESIZE and EXTCODEHASH opcodes for mocked addresses. 
    Previously, these opcodes did not check the mock handler, causing them to 
    return values indicating no code exists at mocked addresses. Fixed by adding 
    `mocked_code` method to `MockHandler` trait to provide dummy bytecode.
