title: "templates: make node compilation optional"

doc:
  - audience: [Node Dev, Runtime Dev]
    description: |
      Node compilation for minimal and parachain templates is made optional, not part of the
      templates `default-members` list. At the same time, we introduce OmniNode as alternative
      to run the templates.
