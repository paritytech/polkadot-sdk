title: 'pallet-revive: Trade code size for call stack depth'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: This will reduce the call stack depth in order to raise the allowed
    code size. Should allow around 100KB of instructions. This is necessary to stay
    within the memory envelope. More code size is more appropriate for testing right
    now. We will re-evaluate parameters once we have 64bit support.
