title: Improve `sc-service` API

doc:

    description: |
      This improves `sc-service` API by not requiring the whole `&Configuration`, using specific configuration options
      instead. `RpcConfiguration` and `ExecutorConfiguration` were also extracted from `Configuration` to group all RPC
      and executor options together.
      If `sc-service` is used as a library with lower-level APIs, `Configuration` can now be avoided in most cases.

      This mainly impacts you on your node implementation. There you need to change this:
      ```
      with_execution_method(config.wasm_method)
      ```

      to this:
      ```
      with_execution_method(config.executor.wasm_method)
      ```

      There are similar changes required as well, but all are around the initialization of the wasm executor.
