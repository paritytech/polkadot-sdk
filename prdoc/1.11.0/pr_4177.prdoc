title: "wasm-builder: Make it easier to build a WASM binary"

doc:
  - audience: [Runtime Dev, Node Dev]
    description: |
      Combines all the recommended calls of the `WasmBuilder` into
      `build_using_defaults()` or `init_with_defaults()` if more changes are required.
      Otherwise the interface doesn't change and users can still continue to use
      the "old" interface.
