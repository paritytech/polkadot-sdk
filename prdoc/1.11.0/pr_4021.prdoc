title: Improve log output for block imports

doc:
  - audience: Node Operator
    description: |
      Nodes now print the parent hash on import notification log messages. In addition, the emoji
      of the log message indicates whether the block was imported as best block or not. "🏆" is used for
      best blocks, "🆕" for other imported blocks.
