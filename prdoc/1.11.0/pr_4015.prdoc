    description: |
      Improve internal implementation of beefy to forward data directly to the
      networking layer instead of first storing them internally. So, the
      following error message should not appear again:
      ```
      The number of unprocessed messages in channel `mpsc_beefy_gossip_validator` exceeded 100000.
      ```
