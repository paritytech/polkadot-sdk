title: "[FRAME] Introduce Runtime Omni Bencher"

doc:
  - audience: Node Dev
    description: |
      Introduces a new freestanding binary; the `frame-omni-bencher`. This can be used as alternative to the node-integrated `benchmark pallet` command. It currently only supports pallet benchmarking.

      The optional change to integrate this MR is in the node. The `run` function is now deprecated in favour or `run_with_spec`. This should be rather easy to integrate:

      ```patch
      runner.sync_run(|config| cmd
      -    .run::<HashingFor<Block>, ReclaimHostFunctions>(config)
      +    .run_with_spec::<HashingFor<Block>, ReclaimHostFunctions>(Some(config.chain_spec))
      )
      ```

      Additionally, a new `--runtime` CLI arg was introduced to the `benchmark pallet` command. It allows to generate the genesis state directly by the runtime, instead of using a spec file.
