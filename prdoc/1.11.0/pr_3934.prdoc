title: Update benchmarking macros

doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      Current benchmarking macro return a closure with the captured benchmarked code.
      This could cause compilation issues when the benchmarked code has complex lifetime requirements.
      This PR updates the existing macro by injecting the recoding parameter and invoking the start / stop method around the benchmarked block instead of returning a closure
