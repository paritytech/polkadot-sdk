title: Add SingleAssetExchangeAdapter

doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      SingleAssetExchangeAdapter is an adapter in xcm-builder that can be used
      to configure the AssetExchanger in XCM to use pallet-asset-conversion.
      It can be configured as follows:
      ```rust
      pub type AssetExchanger = SingleAssetExchangeAdapter<
        // pallet-assets-conversion, as named in `construct_runtime`.
        AssetConversion,
        // The fungibles implementation that brings together all assets in pools.
        // This may be created using `fungible::UnionOf` to mix the native token
        // with more tokens.
        Fungibles,
        // The matcher for making sure which assets should be handled by this exchanger.
        Matcher,
      >;
      ```
      It's called "single asset" since it will only allow exchanging one asset for another.
      It will error out if more than one asset tries to be exchanged.

      Also, a new method was added to the `xcm_executor::traits::AssetExchange` trait:
      `quote_exchange_price`. This is used to get the exchange price between two assets.
      This is NOT a breaking change since it has a default implementation that just doesn't do anything.
