title: "Remove `elastic-scaling-experimental` feature flag"

doc:
  - audience: Node Dev
    description: |
      The feature was masking the ability of collators to respond with `CollationWithParentHeadData`
      to validator collation fetch requests, a requirement for elastic scaling. 
      Please note that `CollationWithParentHeadData` is only sent by collators of parachains with 
      multiple cores assigned, otherwise collators must respond with `CollationFetchingResponse::Collation`
  - audience: Node Operator
    description: |
      This change enables elastic scaling support in collators. Please upgrade to latest version, 
      otherwise validator nodes will not be able to back elastic parachain blocks leading to 
      missed rewards.
