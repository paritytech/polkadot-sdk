doc:
  - audience: Node Dev
    description: |
      This moves the `para_id` from `MockXcmConfig` to `MockValidationDataInherentDataProvider` to make it more prominent. The `para_id` should
      be set to the parachain id of the parachain that gets mocked to ensure that the relay chain storage proof is setup correctly etc.
