    description: |
      Removes the prospective-parachains subsystem from collators. The GetMinimumRelayParents of the implicit view
      is replaced by direct ChainAPI and runtime calls. The subsystem was causing performance problems when collating
      connected to an RPC node, due to the high number of runtime API calls, which were unneccessary for a collator.
