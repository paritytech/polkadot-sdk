title: Avoid unnecessary block gap updates

doc:
  - audience: Node Dev
    description: |
      Previously, the block gap storage in database and state in `BlockchainDb` could be updated even if no changes occurred.
      This commit refines the logic to ensure updates only occur when the block gap value actually changes, reducing unnecessary
      writes and enhancing overall efficiency.
