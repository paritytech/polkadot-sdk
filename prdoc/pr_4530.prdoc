title: "Implement `pallet-assets-holder`"

doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
        This change creates the `pallet-assets-holder` pallet, as well as changes `pallet-assets`
        to support querying held balances via a new trait: `HeldBalance`.
        
        It also adjusts the balance model implementation for fungible
        sets (see [sdk docs](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame_support/traits/tokens/fungible/index.html#visualising-balance-components-together-)).

        The `pallet-assets-holder` implements `hold` traits for `pallet-assets`, by extending this
        pallet and implementing the `HeldBalance` trait so the held balance can be queried by
        `pallet-assets` to calculate the reducible (a.k.a. spendable) balance.
        
        These changes imply adding a configuration type in `pallet-assets` for `Holder`
        
        ## Default implementation of `Holder`
        
        Use `()` as the default value, when no holding capabilities are wanted in the runtime
        implementation.

        ## Enable `pallet-assets-holder`
        
        Define an instance of `pallet-assets-holder` (we'll call it `AssetsHolder`) and use
        `AssetsHolder` as the value for `Holder`, when intend to use holding capabilities are
        wanted in the runtime implementation.
