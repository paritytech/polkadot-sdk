title: Fix XCM decoding inconsistencies

doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      This PR adjusts the XCM decoding logic in order to deduplicate the logic used for decoding `v3::Xcm`, `v4::Xcm`
      and `v5::Xcm` and also to use `decode_with_depth_limit()` in some more places.
      Also `VersionedXcm::validate_xcm_nesting()` is renamed to `VersionedXcm::check_is_decodable()`.
