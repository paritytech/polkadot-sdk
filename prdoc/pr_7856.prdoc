title: Fix XCM decoding inconsistencies

doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      This PR adjusts the XCM decoding logic in order to use `decode_with_depth_limit()` consistently for `VersionedXcm`
      and to deduplicate the logic used for decoding `v3::Xcm`, `v4::Xcm` and `v5::Xcm`.
      Also `VersionedXcm::validate_xcm_nesting()` is renamed to `VersionedXcm::validate_xcm_decoding()`.
