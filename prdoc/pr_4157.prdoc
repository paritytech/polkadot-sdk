title: "Bridge: added free headers submission support to the substrate-relay"

doc:
  - audience: Node Dev
    description: |
      Bridge finality and parachains relayer now supports mode, where it only submits some headers
      for free. There's a setting in a runtime configuration, which introduces this "free header"
      concept. Submitting such header is considered a common good deed, so it is free for relayers.
