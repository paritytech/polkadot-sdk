title: "Grandpa: Ensure voting doesn't fail after a re-org"

doc:
  - audience: Node Operator
    description: |
      Ensures that a node is still able to vote with Grandpa, when a re-org happened that 
      changed the best chain. This ultimately prevents that a network may runs into a 
      potential finality stall.
