title: "Umbrella crate: exclude chain-specific crates"

    description: |
      The `polkadot-sdk` umbrella crate does now not contain chain-specific crates. The reasoning is
      that the SDK should be mostly chain-agnostic. Please check out
      [psvm](https://github.com/paritytech/psvm) to select matching version numbers for chain-
      specific crates.
