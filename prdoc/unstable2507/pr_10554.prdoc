title: '[pallet-revive] add EVM gas call syscalls'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    This PR adds two new syscalls for calls accepting EVM gas instead of Weight and Deposit.

    This is an important change for the initial release as it will align PVM contracts closer to EVM (the problem can't be solved in the Solidity compiler).
