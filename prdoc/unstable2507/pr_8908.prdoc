title: '[pvf-worker] Refactor execute request handling'
doc:
- audience: Node Dev
  description: |-
    PVF execution worker communication was organized into a single ExecuteRequest struct. This should improve performance: one encode/decode operation instead of four. Also, no more chance of ordering mistakes.
