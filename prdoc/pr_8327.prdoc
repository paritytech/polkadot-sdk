    description: |
      The frame-metadata version is bumped to v22 to bring in the latest unstable V16 metadata format. Notably,
      deprecation information has changed slightly, and deprecation notices on the outer Event/Error enums
      are no longer supported (but each variant can still be marked as deprecated).
