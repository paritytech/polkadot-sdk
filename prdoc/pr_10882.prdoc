title: "statement-store: make encode/hash faster"
doc:
- audience: Node Dev
  description: |
    Optimizes statement encoding and hashing by pre-allocating memory for the encoded buffer.
    This reduces allocation overhead and improves performance, particularly when receiving
    statements from multiple peers. Benchmarks show ~16% speedup when receiving statements
    from 16 peers.
