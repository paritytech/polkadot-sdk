title: Use hashbrown hashmap/hashset in validation context
doc:
- audience: Node Dev
  description: |-
    Discovered while profiling https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/6131#issuecomment-2891523233 with the benchmark https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8069 that  when running in validation a big chunk of the time is spent inserting and retrieving data from the BTreeMap/BTreeSet.

    By switching to hashbrown HashMap/HashSet in validation TrieCache and TrieRecorder  and the memory-db https://github.com/paritytech/trie/pull/221 read costs improve with around ~40% and write with about ~20%
