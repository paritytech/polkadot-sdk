title: Fix for Reward Deficit in the pool

doc:
  - audience: Core Dev
    description: Instead of fragile calculation of current balance by looking at free balance - ED, Nomination Pool now freezes ED in the pool reward account to restrict an account from going below minimum balance. This also has a nice side effect that if ED changes, we know how much is the imbalance in ED frozen in the pool and the current required ED. A pool operator can diligently top up the pool with the deficit in ED or vice versa, withdraw the excess they transferred to the pool.
    notes:
      - Introduces new call `adjust_pool_deposit` that allows to top up the deficit or withdraw the excess deposit for the pool.
      - Switch to using Fungible trait from Currency trait.
