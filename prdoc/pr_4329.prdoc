    description: |
      Deprecates the `NativeElseWasmExecutor` as native execution is already
      discouraged and should be removed entirely. The executor should be
      replaced by `WasmExecutor` which can be found in `sc-executor`.

      The `NativeElseWasmExecutor` will be removed at the end of 2024.
