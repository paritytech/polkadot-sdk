title: Unify logic for fetching the `:code` of a block

doc:
  - audience: Node Operator
    description: |
      Fixes an issue on parachains when running with a custom `override` or `substitute` of the on chain wasm code.
      The relay chain was rejecting blocks build this way, because the collator was reporting an incorrect code hash to the relay chain.
      This is now fixed by always sending the code hash as found in the state of the relay chain. Still a warning is printed when
      the code hash doesn't match to inform the operator about the mismatch and its potential impact on the validation.

      `Client::code_at` will now use the same `overrides`/`substitute` to determine the code for a given block as it is
      done when executing any runtime call.
