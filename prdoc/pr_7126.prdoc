title: 'xcm: Fixes for `UnpaidLocalExporter`'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: This PR deprecates `UnpaidLocalExporter` in favor of the new `LocalExporter`. First, the name is misleading, as it can be used in both paid and unpaid scenarios. Second, it contains a hard-coded channel 0, whereas `LocalExporter` uses the same algorithm as `xcm-exporter`.
