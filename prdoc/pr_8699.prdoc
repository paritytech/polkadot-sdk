title: Log dropped `proof_size` when converting `Xcm::Transact`
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: This PR adds logging for dropped `proof_size` when an XCM `Transact`
    instruction undergoes version conversion. This resolves a critical debugging challenge
    by providing visibility into silently discarded `proof_size` information, which
    previously led to misleading weight accounting.
