title: XCMP and DMP improvements
doc:
- audience: [Runtime Dev, Node Dev, Node Operator]
  description: |
    This PR changes the parachain receiving logic for XCMP and DMP by adding some offchain processing
    before forwarding the messages to the parachain `set_validation_data` inherent.
    This enables us to relax the advancement rule.

    The arguments of the `set_validation_data` inherent have been changed.

    This solution involves:
      - changes in the relay chain runtimes
      - changes in the relay chain node client
      - changes in the parachain runtimes
    These changes should be deployed in 2 steps:
    1. Relay chain:
      - the changes to the relay chain runtime
      - the changes to the relay chain node client
      Here, the order shouldnâ€™t matter
    2. The changes to the parachain runtimes
