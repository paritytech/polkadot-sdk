title: 'Cumulus: fix pre-connect to backers for lonely collators'
doc:
- audience: Node Dev
  description: |-
    When running a single collator (most commonly on testnets), the block builder task is always able to claim a slot, so we're never triggering the pre-connect mechanism which happens for slots owned by other authors.
    Additionally I fixed some tests.
