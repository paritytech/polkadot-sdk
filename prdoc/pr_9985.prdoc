title: '`pallet-xcm`: extract precompiles to a separate crate'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    This PR extracts the XCM precompile from `pallet-xcm` into a new standalone crate `pallet-xcm-precompiles` to resolve an unwanted dependency issue. Previously, the XCM precompile was implemented directly in `pallet-xcm/src/precompiles.rs`, which required `pallet-xcm` to depend on `pallet-revive`, introducing it as a transitive dependency for all parachains using `pallet-xcm`.

    Closes #9955
