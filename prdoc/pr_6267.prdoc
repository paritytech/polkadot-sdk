title: Allow configurable number of genesis accounts with specified balances for benchmarking.

doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      This pull request adds an additional field `dev_accounts` to the `GenesisConfig`
      of the balances pallet, feature gated by `runtime-benchmarks`.

      Bringing about an abitrary number of derived dev accounts when building the genesis
      state. Runtime developers should supply a derivation path that includes an index placeholder
      (i.e. "//Sender/{}") to generate multiple accounts from the same root in a consistent
      manner.
