title: Repot all templates

doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      This PR moves all templates into a single folder in the polkadot-sdk repo (`/templates`) and
      unifies their crate names as well. Most notably, the crate name for what was formerly known
      as `node-template` is no `solochain-template-node`. The other two crates in the template are
      consequently called: `solochain-runtime-template` and `pallet-solochain-template`.
      The other two template crate names follow a similar patter, just replacing `solochain` with
      `parachain` or `minimal`.

      This PR is part of a bigger step toward automating the template repositories, see the
      following: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/3155

# the following crates are removed and renamed, although none are released.
crates:
  - name: minimal-template-runtime             # formerly called minimal-runtime
  - name: minimal-template-node                # formerly called minimal-node
  - name: solochain-template-node              # formerly called node-template
  - name: solochain-template-runtime           # formerly called node-template-runtime
  - name: parachain-template-runtime           # formerly called parachain-runtime
  - name: parachain-template-runtime           # formerly called parachain-node
