title: Allow parachain which acquires multiple coretime cores to make progress

doc:
  - audience: Node Operator
    description: |
      Adds the needed changes so that parachains which acquire multiple coretime cores can still make progress.
      Only one of the cores will be able to be occupied at a time.
      Only works if the ElasticScalingMVP node feature is enabled in the runtime and the block author validator is
      updated to include this change.
