    description: |
      The `upload_code` extrinsic, will now only allow non-deterministic code to be uploaded with the `Determinism::Relaxed` flag. 
      This prevent an attacker from uploading "deterministic" code with the `Determinism::Relaxed` flag, preventing the code to be instantiated for on-chain execution.
