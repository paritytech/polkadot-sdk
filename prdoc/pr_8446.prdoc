title: check inherents and equivocations in `import_block`
doc:
- audience: ["Node Operator", "Node Dev"]
  description: |-
    When importing blocks, there are essentially two steps: `verify` and `import_block`. With https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/65, we would like to re-broadcast blocks between these two steps (i.e. basically right after `verify`).

    This PR is the first step to enable that change, by moving `check_inherents` (and equivocation checks) from the `verify` to the `import_block` step (because `verify` does runtime checks that can potentially be expensive, and we don't really need to do those before re-broadcasting).
