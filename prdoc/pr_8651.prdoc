title: 'polkadot-omni-node: add `GetParachainIdentifier` runtime api'
doc:
- audience: [ Node Dev, Node Operator, Runtime Dev ]
  description: |
    This PR deprecates the `para_id` field of parachain chain specifications. 

    - Both `polkadot-omni-node` & `polkadot-parachain` are still supporting the `para_id`
    field passed via chain specifications, while `parachain-template-node` supports only runtime API based provided parachain id.
    - This PR also changes `minimal-template-runtime` to not run anymore with Omni Node.
    - `chain-spec-builder` still supports generating chain specifications with `para_id` field.

    Starting with `stable2509` the `para_id` field of chain specification is not required anymore, and runtime developers will be able
    to specify it to nodes by implementing the runtime API `cumulus_primitives_core::GetParachainIdentifier`.

    Starting with `stable2512` the `para_id` field of chain specification will not be supported anymore by node versions and
    `chain-spec-builder` will drop its support, so it is mandatory for runtimes to implement the `GetParachainIdentifier` trait
    to still be compatible with the nodes.
