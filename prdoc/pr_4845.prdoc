title: Make approval-distribution logic runnable on a separate thread

doc:
  - audience: Node Dev
    description: |
      Pass SubsystemSender<M> trait inside approval-distribution instead of passing SubsystemContext everywhere.

      This allows us in the future to be able to run multiple approval-distribution instances on different workers.
