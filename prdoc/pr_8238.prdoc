title: Add `checked_sqrt` to the `FixedPointNumber` trait

doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    Adds the function `checked_sqrt` to the `FixedPointNumber` trait, and deprecates `const fn try_sqrt` inside
    of the `implement_fixed` macro in favor of a `const fn checked_sqrt` which does the same thing. This affects 
    [`FixedI64`, `FixedU64`, `FixedI128`, `FixedU128`].
