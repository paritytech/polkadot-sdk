    ## Multi Block Election Pallet

    This PR adds the first iteration of the multi-block staking pallet.

    From this point onwards, the staking and its election provider pallets are being customized to work in AssetHub. While usage in solo-chains is still possible, it is not longer the main focus of this pallet. For a safer usage, please fork and user an older version of this pallet.
