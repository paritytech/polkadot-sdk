title: deprecate AsyncBackingParams
doc:

- audience: [Node Dev, Runtime Dev]
  description: |-
    Removes all usage of the static async backing params, replacing them with dynamically computed equivalent values (based on the claim queue and scheduling lookahead).

    Adds a new runtime API for querying the scheduling lookahead value. If not present, falls back to 3 (the default value that is backwards compatible with values we have on production networks for allowed_ancestry_len)

    Also removes most code that handles async backing not yet being enabled, which includes support for collation protocol version 1 on collators, as it only worked for leaves not supporting async backing (which are none).
