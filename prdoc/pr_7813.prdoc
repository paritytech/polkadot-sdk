title: Improve metadata for `SkipCheckIfFeeless`
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    If the inner transaction extension used inside `SkipCheckIfFeeless` are multiples then the metadata is not correct, it is now fixed.

    E.g. if the transaction extension is `SkipCheckIfFeeless::<Runtime, (Payment1, Payment2)>` then the metadata was wrong.
