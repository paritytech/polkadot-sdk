title: Snowbridge: Unpaid execution when bridging to Ethereum
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    Since in Snowbridge V2 the execution fee on Ethereum will be estimated on the fly 
    and injected into the XCM, there is no need to preconfigure the bridge fee. 
    Additionally, we want to avoid maintaining Asset Hubâ€™s sovereign account on Bridge Hub.
