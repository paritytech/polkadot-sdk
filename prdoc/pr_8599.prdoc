title: Snowbridge: Unpaid execution when bridging to Ethereum
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    Since all fees in Snowbridge V2 will be estimated on the fly and injected into the XCM, there is 
    no need to preconfigure a bridge fee using SovereignPaidRemoteExporter. Additionally, we want to 
    avoid maintaining Asset Hubâ€™s sovereign account on Bridge Hub.
