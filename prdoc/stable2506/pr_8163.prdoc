title: 'chore: idiomatic rust cleanup'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: "Description\n\nThis PR performs a series of non-functional refactors\
    \ across multiple files to improve code readability and consistency.\n\nKey changes\
    \ include:\n\t\u2022\tReplacing verbose pattern matches with shorter .ok(), .err(),\
    \ or .ok_or()? alternatives.\n\t\u2022\tUsing div_ceil() instead of manual (x\
    \ + 1) / 2 calculations for better clarity.\n\t\u2022\tRemoving redundant .clone().take()\
    \ patterns to simplify logic.\n\t\u2022\tApplying consistent and idiomatic Rust\
    \ expressions throughout the codebase.\n\nThese changes do not affect runtime\
    \ functionality, but improve maintainability and align the code with modern Rust\
    \ practices.\n\nIntegration\n\nNo integration steps are required. These are non-functional\
    \ refactors that do not alter the runtime behavior or public APIs. Downstream\
    \ projects should experience no impact.\n\nReview Notes\n\nAll changes are cosmetic\
    \ or idiomatic improvements:\n\t\u2022\tEach change was tested to ensure it preserves\
    \ the original behavior.\n\t\u2022\tFocus was on readability, simplicity, and\
    \ reducing redundancy.\n\t\u2022\tNo logic paths were altered; only how those\
    \ paths are expressed."
