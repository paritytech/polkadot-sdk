title: 'gossip-support: make low connectivity message an error'

    All is not well when a validator is not properly connected, e.g: of things that might happen:
    - Finality might be slightly delay because validator will be no-show because they can't retrieve PoVs to validate approval work: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/8915.
    - When they author blocks they won't back things because gossiping of backing statements happen using the grid topology:, e.g blocks authored by validators with a low number of peers:

    The problem is seen in `polkadot_parachain_peer_count` metrics, but it seems people are not monitoring that well enough, so let's make it more visible nodes with low connectivity are not working in good conditions.

    I also reduced the threshold to 85%, so that we don't trigger this error to eagerly.
