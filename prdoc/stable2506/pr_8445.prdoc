title: Fix the clearing of gap sync on known imported blocks

    description: |
      This PR ensures that warp sync gaps are properly cleared when known blocks are imported. Previously, gaps were only removed in response to ImportedUnknown events.
      This limitation caused issues for asset-hub and bridge-hub collators, which remained stuck in the "Block history" state without progressing.
      The root cause lies in the client.info() reporting a gap during node startup or restart (ie block verification fails). In some cases, a peer may respond with the missing blocks after weâ€™ve already imported them locally, leaving the gap open.
