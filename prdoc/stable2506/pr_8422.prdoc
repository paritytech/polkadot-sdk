title: '[AHM] Staking async fixes for XCM and election planning'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    This PR brings a few small fixes related to the XCM messages of stkaing-async, among other small fixes:


    * [x] Allows `xcm::validate` to check the message size, and we actually now act upon it in the `staking-async-rc/parachain-runtime`s. The code is a bit duplicate now, and there is a TOOD about how to better refactor it later.
    * [x] Part of this work is backported separately as https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8409
    * [x] It brings a default `EraElectionPlannerOf` which should be the right tool to use to ensure elections always happen in time, with an educated guess based on `ElectionProvider::duration` rather than a random number.
    * [x] It adds a few unit tests about the above
    * [x] It silences some logs that were needlessly `INFO`, and makes the printing of some types a bit more CLI friendly.
    * [x] Renames `type SessionDuration` in `staking-async` to `type RelaySessionDuration` for better clarity.
