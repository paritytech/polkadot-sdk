title: Fix pallet_migrations benchmark when FailedMigrationHandler emits events
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: When FailedMigrationHandler emits events, the `UpgradeFailed` event
    is not the last one, so `assert_last_event` fails. Fixed by checking that the
    `UpgradeFailed` event is emitted, even if it is not the last one.
