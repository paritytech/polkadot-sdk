title: Pallet XCM - transfer_assets pre-ahm patch

doc:
  - audience: Runtime User
    description: |
      Pallet XCM's `transfer_assets` extrinsic now returns an error when it determines that a
      reserve transfer of DOT|KSM|WND|PAS has to be done.
      This is a safeguard in preparation for the Asset Hub Migration (AHM), where the reserve
      of DOT|KSM|WND|PAS will change from the Relay Chain to Asset Hub.
      After the migration, another patch will remove this error case and use the correct reserve.
      `limited_reserve_transfer_assets`, `transfer_assets_using_type_and_then` or `execute` should
      be used instead, since they provide the ability to specify the reserve you want to use.

      The pallet uses the `UniversalLocation` configuration to figure out the correct asset
      being transferred. It's very important to have that configuration correct.
