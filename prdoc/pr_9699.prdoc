    fixes https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/9621

    Behavior of `terminate` is changed in accordance with EIP-6780 (and EVM in general):
    - `terminate` only deletes the code from storage if it is called in the same transaction the contract was created.
    - `terminate` does not destroy the contract instantly. The contract is registered for destruction, which happens at the end of the transaction.
