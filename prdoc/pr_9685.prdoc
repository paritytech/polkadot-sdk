title: Upgrade litep2p to v0.12.0
doc:
- audience: Node Dev
  description: litep2p v0.12.0 adds ability to track whether publishing a DHT record
    or provider was successful. This PR brings this functionality to substrate. Particularly,
    this fixes authority-discovery unnecessarily republishing DHT records due to litep2p
    not emitting `KademliaEvent::PutRecordSuccess` before v0.12.0.
