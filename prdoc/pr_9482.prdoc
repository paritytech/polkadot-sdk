title: '[pallet-revive] expose `exec::Key`'
doc:

  description: |-
    This is a fix for the fact that `exec::Key` is exposed from within `pallet_revive::tracing::Tracing` interface, but not from the crate itself making custom tracers effectively unimplementable outside said crate.

    In my case it's useful for implementing custom tracers for integration with `foundry`
