title: 'Society pallet supports non-consecutive block provider'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    Society pallet correctly handles situations where on_initialize is invoked with block numbers that:
    - increase but are not strictly consecutive (e.g., jump from 5 â†’ 10), or
    - are repeated (e.g., multiple blocks are built at the same Relay Chain parent block, all reporting the same BlockNumberProvider value).
    This situation may occur when the BlockNumberProvider is not local - for example, on a parachain using the Relay Chain block number provider.
