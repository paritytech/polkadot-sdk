title: '`apply_authorized_force_set_current_code` does not need to consume the whole
  block'
doc:
- audience: Runtime User
  description: |-
    There is no need that this dispatchable consumes the full block as this is just writing the given value to storage. On a chain this is done, because the runtime changes and thus, a lot of stuff potentially changes. In the case of the relay chain only on parachain changes and not the relay chain runtime itself.
