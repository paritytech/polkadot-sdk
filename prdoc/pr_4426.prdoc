title: "Remove warning about `BadCertificate`"

doc:
  - audience: Node Operator
    description: |
      The node was printing the following warning from time to time:
      ```
      Sending fatal alert BadCertificate
      ```

      This is not an user error and thus, the warning will now not be printed
      anymore.
