title: Add possibility of executing or mocking additional inherents in xcm-emulator
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
   This extends the `decl_test_parachains` macro to accept a `AdditionalInherentCode` type. This type needs to
   implement the `AdditionalInherentCode` trait and will be called after `on_initialize` and before `on_finalize`.
   It can be used to mock additional inherents.
