title: Fix version conversion in XcmPaymentApi::query_weight_to_asset_fee.

doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      The `query_weight_to_asset_fee` function of the `XcmPaymentApi` was trying
      to convert versions in the wrong way.
      This resulted in all calls made with lower versions failing.
      The version conversion is now done correctly and these same calls will now succeed.
