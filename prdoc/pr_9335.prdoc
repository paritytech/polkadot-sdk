- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    This pull requests adds some storage values to the whitelisted storage item list, because they are written in every block. Also it stops double killing `InherentsApplied`. It is killed in `on_finalize`, so there is no need to do it again in `on_initialize`.
