title: 'omni-node: Tolerate failing metadata check'
doc:
- audience: Node Operator
  description: |-
    #6450 introduced metadata checks. Supported are metadata v14 and higher.

    However, of course old chain-specs have a genesis code blob that might be on older version. This needs to be tolerated. We should just skip the checks in that case.

    Fixes #6921
