title: On-demand credits

doc:
  - audience: [ Runtime User, Runtime Dev ]
    description: |
      The PR implements functionality on the relay chain for purchasing on-demand 
      Coretime using credits. This means on-demand Coretime should no longer be 
      purchased with the relay chain balance but rather with credits acquired 
      on the Coretime chain. The extrinsic to use for purchasing Coretime is 
      `place_order_with_credits`. It is worth noting that the PR also introduces
      a minimum credit purchase requirement to prevent potential attacks.
