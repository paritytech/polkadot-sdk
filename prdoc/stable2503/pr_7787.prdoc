title: Add asset-hub-next as a trusted teleporter
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    Asset Hub Next has been deployed on Westend as parachain 1100, but it's not yet a trusted teleporter.
    This minimal PR adds it in stable2412 so that it can be deployed right away without waiting for the rest of the release to be finalised and deployed.
