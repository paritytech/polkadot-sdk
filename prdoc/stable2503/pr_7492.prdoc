title: Make `pallet-bridge-rewards` generic over `RewardKind`
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    The PR enhances the pallet-bridge-rewards by making it generic over the `Reward` type (previously hardcoded as `RewardsAccountParams`). This modification allows the pallet to support multiple reward types (e.g., P/K bridge, Snowbridge), increasing its flexibility and applicability across various bridge scenarios.

    Other pallets can register rewards using bp_relayers::RewardLedger, which is implemented by the rewards pallet. The runtime can then be configured with different mechanisms for paying/claiming rewards via bp_relayers::PaymentProcedure (e.g., see the pub struct BridgeRewardPayer; implementation for BridgeHubWestend).
