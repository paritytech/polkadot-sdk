title: '[pallet-revive] Fix `caller_is_root` return value'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: The return type of the host function `caller_is_root` was denoted as `u32`
    in `pallet_revive_uapi`. This PR fixes the return type to `bool`. As a drive-by, the
    PR re-exports `pallet_revive::exec::Origin` to extend what can be tested externally.
