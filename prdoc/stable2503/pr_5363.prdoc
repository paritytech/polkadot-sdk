title: "[pallet-xcm] waive transport fees based on XcmConfig"

doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      pallet-xcm::send() no longer implicitly waives transport fees for the local root location,
      but instead relies on xcm_executor::Config::FeeManager to determine whether certain locations have free transport.

      ðŸš¨ Warning: ðŸš¨ If your chain relies on free transport for local root, please make
      sure to add Location::here() to the waived-fee locations in your configured xcm_executor::Config::FeeManager.
