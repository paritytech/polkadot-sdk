    # Description

    * This PR adds a new extrinsic `poke_deposit` to `pallet-society`. This extrinsic will be used to re-adjust the deposits made in the pallet to create a bid after AHM.
    * Part of #5591

    ## Review Notes

    * Added a new extrinsic `poke_deposit` in `pallet-society`.
    * Added a new event `DepositPoked` to be emitted upon a successful call of the extrinsic.
    * Although the immediate use of the extrinsic will be to give back some of the deposit after the AH-migration, the extrinsic is written such that it can work if the deposit decreases or increases (both).
    * The call to the extrinsic would be `free` if an actual adjustment is made to the deposit and `paid` otherwise.
    * Added tests to test all scenarios.
    * Added benchmark
