title: '[pallet-revive] implement the base fee API'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: This PR implements the base fee syscall API method. Currently this
    is implemented as a compile time constant in the revive compiler, returning 0.
    However, since this is an opocde, if we ever need to implement it for compatibility
    reasons with [EIP-1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md),
    it would break already deployed contracts. Thus we provide a syscall method instead.
