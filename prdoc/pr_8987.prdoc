title: 'EPMB/unsigned: fixed multi-page winner computation'
doc:
- audience: Runtime User
  description: |-
    Change the calculation of `MaxWinnersPerPage` in `FullSupportsOfMiner` to `Pages * MaxWinnersPerPage` (instead of the overall maximum number of winners across pages)
    to prevent the computed solution from having a low overall total of winners, which could result in a `WrongWinnerCount` error.
