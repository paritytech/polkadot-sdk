title: Support different assets for delivery fees

doc:
  - audience: Runtime User
    description: |
      We now support different assets for delivery fees.
      This means reserve asset transfers from one parachain to another going through AssetHub
      no longer need DOT/KSM to pay for delivery fees on AssetHub.
      They work as long as there is any asset which has a pool with DOT/KSM on AssetHub.
      Right now paying delivery fees with a different asset locally is not supported, but it will
      be in the future.
      This PR supports different assets for remote delivery fees.

      In order to support different assets for delivery fees, the existing AssetExchanger config item
      was leveraged.
      This config item allows exchanging assets and quoting exchange prices.
      An adapter was added to `xcm-builder` to make it compatible with `pallet-asset-conversion`:
      `SingleAssetExchangeAdapter`.
      The new functionality in the executor pays delivery fees using only one asset, which might be
      swapped to the correct one.
      If you have a custom XcmRouter that returns more than one asset needed for delivery fees, then know
      that only the first one will be used.
      No XcmRouter provided by the SDK returns more than one asset.
