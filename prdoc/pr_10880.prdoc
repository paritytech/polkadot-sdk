title: remove invalid voter count assertion due to PendingRebag

- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    Refers to: #10687

    This PR comments out the section where the error occurs due to the implementation of `PendingRebag` (#9725). This change resolves the issue but may lead to a misalignment where the VoterList count no longer matches the sum of Nominations and Validators.
