doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: PR resolves the error that occurs when VoterList count does not align
    with sum of Nominators & Validators in bags-list & tests to ensure PendingRebag fills when bags list is locked. This misalignment happens while
    bags-list is locked & nominations/validations are received.
