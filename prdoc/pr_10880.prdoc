title: Remove failing assertion related to VoterList count mismatch
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: PR resolves the error that occurs when VoterList count does not align
    with sum of Nominations & Validators in bags-list. This misalignment happens while
    bags-list is locked & nominations/validations are received. Eventually this misalignment
    evens out due `PendingRebag` implementation
