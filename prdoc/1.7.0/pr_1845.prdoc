title: "XCM WeightTrader: Swap Fee Asset for Native Asset"

doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      Implements an XCM executor `WeightTrader`, facilitating fee payments in any asset that can be exchanged for a native asset.

      A few constraints need to be observed:
      - `buy_weight` and `refund` operations must be atomic, as another weight trader implementation might be attempted in case of failure.
      - swap credit must be utilized since there isnâ€™t an account to which an asset of some class can be deposited with a guarantee to meet the existential deposit requirement.
