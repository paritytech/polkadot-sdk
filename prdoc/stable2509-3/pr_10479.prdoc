    This PR updates rust-yamux to 0.13.8 from 0.13.6:
    - https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/9169

    This aims at not polling sockets past the point they return errors and effectively avoids panics when tungstenite websocket connections are used in combination with rust-yamux.


    The fix was backported on 2512 but not on 2509
