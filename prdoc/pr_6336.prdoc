title: "pallet-xcm: add support to authorize aliases"

doc:
  - audience: Runtime User
    description: |
      Added new `add_authorized_alias()` and `remove_authorized_alias()` calls to `pallet-xcm`.
      These can be used by a "caller" to explicitly authorize another location to alias into the "caller" origin.
      Usually useful to allow one's local account to be aliased into from a remote location also under
      one's control (one's account on another chain).
      WARNING: make sure that you as the caller `origin` trust the `aliaser` location to act in your name on this
      chain. Once authorized using this call, the `aliaser` can freely impersonate `origin` in XCM programs
      executed on the local chain.

  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      Added `AuthorizedAliases` type exposed by `pallet-xcm`, that acts as a filter for explicitly authorized
      aliases using `pallet-xcm::add_authorized_alias()` and `pallet-xcm::remove_authorized_alias()`.
      Runtime developers can simply plug this `pallet-xcm::AuthorizedAliases` type in their runtime's `XcmConfig`,
      specifically in `<XcmConfig as xcm_executor::Config>::Aliasers`.
