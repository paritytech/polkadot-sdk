      This PR introduces changes to the collator protocol to support elastic scaling.
      Namely, a new variant added to the collation response to include parent head-data
      along with the collation. Currently, the new variant is not being used.

      Validators are required to upgrade to this version before collators in order to
      support the elastic scaling of parachains.
