title: Add Missing Events for Balances Pallet

doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
        This PR improves accounting by implementing missing events for hold, release, credit drops and debt drop operation:

        Emit events for hold-related operations (`Held`, `Released`, `BurnedHeld`, `TransferOnHold`, `TransferAndHold`, `BurnedDebt`, `MintedCredit`).

        Adjust total issuance automatically when `PositiveImbalance` or `NegativeImbalance` are dropped via the `HandleImbalanceDrop` trait.
