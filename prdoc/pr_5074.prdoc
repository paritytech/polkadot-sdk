      Since Rococo is now deprecated, we need another testnet to detect bleeding-edge changes 
      to Substrate, Polkadot, BEEFY consensus protocols that could brick the bridge.

      Like Rococo this PR enables the fast-runtime feature by default which is easier 
      for testing beefy stuff on westend-local.
