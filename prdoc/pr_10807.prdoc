title: 'Omni-node: Move timestamps closer to now'
doc:
- audience: Node Dev
  description: |-
    In omni-node dev-mode the timestamps where showing close to the unix epoch. Technically not a problem, but its a bit more aesthetic if they are closer to now, as requested in https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/10759.

    I set them arbitrarily to two hours in the past so that they do not run immediately into the future.
