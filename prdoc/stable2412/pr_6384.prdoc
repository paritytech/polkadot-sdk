title: Relax requirements on `assign_core`.

  description: |-
    Relax requirements for `assign_core` so that it accepts updates for the last scheduled entry.
    This will allow the coretime chain to split up assignments into multiple
    messages, which allows for interlacing down to single block granularity.
