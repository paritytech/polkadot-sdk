title: 'pallet-revive: Use `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` if set'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: We were not passing through the `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` variable to the
    `build.rs` script of our fixtures. This means that setting the toolchain like
    `cargo +1.81 build` had no effect on the fixture build. It would always fall back
    to the default toolchain.
