title: "Move bitfield_distribution to blocking task pool and set capacity to 8192"

doc:
  - audience: Node Dev
    description: |
      This is moving bitfield_distribution to the blocking task pool because it does cpu
      intensive work and to make it snappier. Additionally, also increase the message
      capacity of the subsystem to make sure the queue does not get full if there is a
      burst of messages.
