  - audience: Node Dev
    description: |
     Make approval-voting subsystem runnable on a separate worker thread without having to
     to always pass to it an orchestra context. It achieves that by refactoring existing functions
     to require only the minimal set of traits needed in the function instead of the general
     `Context`
