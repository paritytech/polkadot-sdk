title: Improve `CheckMetadataHash` transaction extension weight and logic

doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      The compilation now panics if the optional compile-time environment variable `RUNTIME_METADATA_HASH` contains an invalid value.
      The weight for the `CheckMetadataHash` transaction extension is more accurate as it is almost compile-time.
