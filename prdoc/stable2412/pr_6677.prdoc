title: 'chore: Update litep2p to v0.8.2'
doc:
- audience: Node Dev
  description: |-
    This includes a critical fix for debug release versions of litep2p (which are running in Kusama as validators).

    While at it, have stopped the oncall pain of alerts around `incoming_connections_total`. We can rethink the metric expose of litep2p in Q1.
