title: 'xcm: fix local/remote exports when inner routers return `NotApplicable`'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
   Resolved a bug in the `local/remote exporters` used for bridging. Previously, they consumed `dest` and `msg` without returning them when inner routers/exporters failed with `NotApplicable`. This PR ensures compliance with the [`SendXcm`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/master/polkadot/xcm/src/v5/traits.rs#L449-L450) and [`ExportXcm`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/master/polkadot/xcm/xcm-executor/src/traits/export.rs#L44-L45) traits.
