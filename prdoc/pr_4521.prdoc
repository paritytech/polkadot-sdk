      The broker pallet price adaptation interface is changed to be less opinionated and more
      information is made available to the `AdaptPrice` trait. A new example impl is included which
      adapts the price based not on the number of cores sold, but rather on the price that was
      achieved during the sale to mitigate a potential price manipulation vector. More information
      here:

      The price controller of the Rococo and Westend Coretime chain will be
      adjusted with this release. This will very likely be used in the
      fellowship production runtime to have a much larger leadin. This fixes a
      price manipulation issue we discovered with the Kusama launch.
