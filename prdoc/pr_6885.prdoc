title: 'Omni-node: Detect pending code in storage and send go ahead signal in dev-mode.'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    We check if there is a pending validation code in storage. If there is, add the go-ahead signal in the relay chain storage proof.

    Not super elegant, but should get the job done for development.
