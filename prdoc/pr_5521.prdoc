title: Allow to call arbitrary runtime apis using RelayChainInterface

doc:
  - audience: Node Dev
    description: |
      This PR adds a `call_runtime_api` method to RelayChainInterface trait, and a separate function also named `call_runtime_api`
      which allows the caller to specify the input and output types, as opposed to having to encode them.
