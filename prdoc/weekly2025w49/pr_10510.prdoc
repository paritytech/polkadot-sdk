title: '[pallet-revive] fix delegate_call_contract in evm-test-suites'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: evm-test-suite was not correctly executing delegate_call_contract causing
    pallet-revive to silently reject the delegatecall. After evm-test-suite was fixed
    we found that the trace for delegate calls is incorrect. This fixes it.
