title: remove enable_approval_voting_parallel cli flag
doc:
- audience: Node Dev
  description: This has been running on polkadot since https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7504,
    so it is time to remove the flag that allowed us to run either with approval-voting-parallel
    or with approval-distribution and approval-voting subsystems.
