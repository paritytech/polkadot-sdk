title: 'Collator: Fix `can_build_upon` by always allowing to build on included block'
doc:
- audience: Node Dev
  description: |-
    Fixes a bug introduced in #6825.
    We should always allow building on the included block of parachains. In situations where the unincluded segment
    is full, but the included block moved to the most recent block, building was wrongly disallowed.
