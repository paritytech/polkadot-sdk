title: Migrate Pallet Identity from Currency to fungible
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    This refactor changes the usage of the deprecated `ReservableCurrency` trait in favour of
    `fungible::MutateHold` to handle deposits for `pallet-identity`.

    This change includes a migration (`LazyMigrationV2ToV3`) to store holds for the existing
    reserves.

    Runtimes using this pallet must change the `Currency` type for `Balances`, add the `OldCurrency`
    benchmarking type, and run the migration.
