title: Remove all XCM dependencies from `pallet-revive`
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: This PR removes all XCM dependencies from `pallet-revive`, including
    the `mock-network` crate which was primarily used to test the unstable `xcm_execute`
    and `xcm_send` APIs. These APIs (along their respective tests) will be moved to
    the XCM precompile in `pallet-xcm` to avoid cyclic dependencies.
