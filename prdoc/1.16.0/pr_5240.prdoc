title: Warn on empty public-addr when starting a validator node

doc:
  - audience: Node Operator
    description: |
      This PR shows a warning when the `--public-addr` CLI parameter is missing for validators.
      In the future, we'll transform this warning into a hard failure.
      Validators are encouraged to provide this parameter for better availability over the network.
