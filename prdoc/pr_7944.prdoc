title: Allow to set a worst case buy execution fee asset and weight
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    Allows to set a worst case for the `BuyExecution` XCM instruction
    benchmark. Currently the benchmark assumes best case scenario (i.e.)
    the case where does not even need to go into the Trader. This PR allows
    developers to set the worst-case scenario as they wish.
    
    Breaking changes:
      - Change `fee_asset` in the benchmarking helper to `worst_case_for_trader` which
        now should return both the `fee_asset` and the weight to use
