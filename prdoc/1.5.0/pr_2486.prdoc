    description: |
      Secure Validator Mode has been enabled for Polkadot validators by default.
      This enforces PVF validation security, and prevents starting a validator node if some security features are missing on the machine.
      SVM can be disabled using the `--insecure-validator-i-know-what-i-do` flag.
