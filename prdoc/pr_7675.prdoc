title: "Bandersnatch hot fix version"

  - audience: [Runtime Dev, Node Dev]
    description: |
      Essentially, this locks `bandersnatch_vrfs` to a specific branch of a repository I control.
      This is a temporary workaround to avoid issues like
      https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/7653 until
      https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7669 is ready.
