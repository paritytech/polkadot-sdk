title: '`fatxpool`: add labels for mempool revalidation invalid txs counting'
doc:
- audience: [ Node Dev, Node Operator ]
  description: |-
    This PR considers errors propagated from mempool revalidation in the context of fork-aware transaction pool and groups them under unique labels to count them under `mempool_revalidation_invalid_txs` prometheus metric. This results in a breakdown of the type of root causes for why a transaction is considered invalid, helping with debugging.
