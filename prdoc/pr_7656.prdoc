    This PR contains improved test cases that rely on the governance location as preparation for AHM to capture the state as it is.
    It introduces `execute_as_governance_call`, which can be configured with various governance location setups instead of the hard-coded `Location::parent()`.

    Additionally, it adds a test for `authorize_upgrade` to all SP testnets.


    ## TODO
    - [x] rewrite all tests using `RuntimeHelper::<Runtime>::execute_as_governance` (because it is using hard-coded `Location::parent()`) to use `RuntimeHelper::<Runtime>::execute_as_governance_call`

    ## Follow-up
    - [ ] add similar test for westend-runtime
    - [ ] add test that ensure xcm-executor adds `ClearOrigin` before all side-effect sent to different chain
