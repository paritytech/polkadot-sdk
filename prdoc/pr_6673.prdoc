title: 'chain-spec-guide-runtime: path to wasm blob fixed'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: In `chain-spec-guide-runtime` crate's tests, there was assumption that
    release version of wasm blob exists. This PR uses `chain_spec_guide_runtime::runtime::WASM_BINARY_PATH`
    const to use correct path to runtime blob.
