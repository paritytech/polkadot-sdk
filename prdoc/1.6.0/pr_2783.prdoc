    description: |
      Dispatchables of `pallet-sudo` will now also accept the `Root` origin
      as valid `sudo` origin. This enhancement is useful for parachains that
      allow the relay chain as a superuser. It enables the relay chain to send
      an XCM message to initialize the sudo key.
