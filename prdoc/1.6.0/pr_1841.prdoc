title: Validator disabling in Statement Distribution.

doc:
  - audience: Node Operator
    description: |
      Once a validator has been disabled for misbehavior, other validators
      should no longer gossip its backing statements in the current era.
      If they do, it might result in disconnects from the network due to low
      reputation.
