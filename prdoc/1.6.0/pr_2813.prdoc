title: "Implement only sending one notification at a time as per RFC 56"

doc:
  - audience: Node Dev
    description: |
      Transactions are now gossiped one at a time instead of as batches, as per RFC 56. This
      allows decoding notifications without knowing how to decode individual transactions, and
      allows for a more fine grained backpressure.
