title: "Interlacing removes the region on which it is performed."

    description: |
      The current implementation of the broker pallet does not remove
      the region on which the interlacing is performed. This can create
      a vulnerability, as the original region owner is still allowed to 
      assign a task to the region even after transferring an interlaced
      part of it.
