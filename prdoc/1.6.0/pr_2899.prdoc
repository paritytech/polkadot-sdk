title: Improve storage monitor API

doc:
  - audience: Node Dev
    description: |
      This removes the need to unnecessarily provide a very specific data structure DatabaseSource and removes huge
      sc-client-db dependency from storage monitor. It is now possible to use storage monitor with any path.
