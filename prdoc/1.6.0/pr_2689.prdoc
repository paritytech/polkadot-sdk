title: BEEFY: Support compatibility with Warp Sync - Allow Warp Sync for Validators

doc:
  - audience: Node Operator
    description: |
      BEEFY can now sync itself even when using Warp Sync to sync the node. This removes the limitation of not
      being able to run BEEFY when warp syncing. Validators are now again able to warp sync.
