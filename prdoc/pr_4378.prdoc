title: "Use `versioned_type!` macro for `VersionedXcm`"

doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      Currently, all other versioned types in the `staging-xcm` are created using `versioned_type!` macro, except for `VersionedXcm`. 
      This PR changes `versioned_type` macro so that it can be used for `VersionedXcm` as well, reducing a lot of duplication. This is done by adding optional
      generic type param to an enum that is passed to the macro.
