title: "pallet_revive: use real storage when building the eth genesis block"
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    When building the eth genesis block, query the real storage items that store the timestamp and block number instead of using the zeroed items.
    If the chainspec does not customise these, they will remain zeroed.
