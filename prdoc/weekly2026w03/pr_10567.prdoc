title: '[Revive] Fix construction of negative zero SignedGas'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    Closes https://github.com/paritytech-secops/srlabs_findings/issues/603

    This fixes an issue where a zero `SignedGas` value can be constructed that uses the `Negative` variant. The rest of the code relies on the invariant that zero `SignedGas` has always the `Positive` variant and this is also documented in the code.
