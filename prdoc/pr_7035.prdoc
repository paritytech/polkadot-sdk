title: Allow declaration and usage of multiple transaction extension version in FRAME and primitives

        This PR enhance `UncheckedExtrinsic` type with a new optional generic: `ExtensionOtherVersion`.
        This generic defaults to `InvalidVersion` meaning there is not other version than the regular version 0. This is the same behavior as before this PR.

        # Breaking change

        The types `Preamble`, `CheckedExtrinsic` and `ExtrinsicFormat` also have this new optional generic. Their type definition also have changed a bit, the `General` variant was 2 fields, the version and the extension, it is now only one field, the extension, and the version can be retrieve by calling `extension.version()`

        The type inference for those types may fail because of this PR, to update the code, write some partial type: `UncheckedExtrinsic<_, _, _, _>`, `Preamble<_, _, _>`, `ExtrinsicFormat<_, _> and `CheckedExtrinsic<_, _, _>`.

        # New feature

        To use this new feature, you can use the new types `TxExtLineAtVers` and `MultiVersion` to define a transaction extension with multiple version:

        ```rust
        pub type TransactionExtensionV0 = ();
        pub type TransactionExtensionV4 = ();
        pub type TransactionExtensionV7 = ();

        pub type OtherVersions = MultiVersion<
            TxExtLineAtVers<4, TransactionExtensionV4>;
            TxExtLineAtVers<7, TransactionExtensionV7>;
        >;

        pub type UncheckedExtrinsic = generic::UncheckedExtrinsic<
            AccountId,
            RuntimeCall,
            UintAuthorityId,
            TransactionExtensionV0, // The version 0, same as before
            OtherVersions, // The other versions.
        >;
        ```
