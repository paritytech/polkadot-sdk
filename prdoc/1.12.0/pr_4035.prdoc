title: "Prospective parachains rework"

doc:
  - audience: Node Dev
    description: |
      Changes prospective-parachains from dealing with trees of unincluded candidates to maintaining only candidate chains
      and a number of unconnected candidates (for which we don't yet know the parent candidate but which otherwise seem potentially viable).
      This is needed for elastic scaling, in order to have full throughput even if a candidate is validated by a backing group before the parent candidate
      is fetched from the other backing group.
      Also simplifies the subsystem by no longer allowing parachain cycles.
