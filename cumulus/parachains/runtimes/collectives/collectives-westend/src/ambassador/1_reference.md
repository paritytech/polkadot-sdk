3,Code of Conduct,,,52,We need the Ambassador Fellowship code of conduct to mirror that of the Technical Fellowship.
3,Code of Conduct,,,53,"We need Ambassador Fellowship members to uphold the following tenets faithfully. Clarifications to the rules should be in agreement with these tenets. Acting in clear breach of these tenets may be considered by voters as grounds for non-promotion, demotion, or, in extreme cases, exclusion from the Ambassador Fellowship.
        - (1) Sincerely uphold the interests of Polkadot and avoid actions that work against it.
        - (2) Respect the philosophy and principles of Polkadot.
        - (3) Respect the Ambassador Fellowship's operational procedures, norms, and voting conventions.
        - (4) Respect your fellow members and the community in general, seeking to act at all times with integrity and professionalism in your interactions."
4,The Operation,,,54,"We need operational rules to evolve relative to who composes the Ambassador Fellowship and be driven by the community's current needs. As much as possible, they should remain a social agreement between members of the collective, built on discussions, common consensus, and past votes."
4,The Operation,,,55,"We need the operational guidelines for the Ambassador Fellowship’s membership to be as outlined below. They suggest the process for joining, advancing in rank, and maintaining status, at least for the program's initial phase.

        - All individuals can become Ambassadors for Polkadot.
        - There are no limits to the number of Ambassadors at any rank
        - Ambassadors are expected to have achieved different levels of work and outcomes to be promoted to the next rank.
        - Each rank should require an ever-increasing level of involvement, dedication, and results that reflect the legitimacy the title will convey to its bearer.
        - The Ambassador Fellowship must relieve OpenGov from most meaningless solicitation and should embrace self-management."
4.1.1,The Operation,,,56,"We need each rank to have criteria for promotion and demotion, with exception for the rank 6 that cannot be promoted any higher, and rank 0 that cannot be demoted any lower."
4.1.1,The Operation,Onboarding and Offboarding,Onboarding,57,"We need rank 0 to be primarily where new accounts are onboarded into the Ambassador Fellowship, with exception for the initial seeding and to revoke the rank of an account."
4.1.1,The Operation,Onboarding and Offboarding,Onboarding,58,We need onboarding into Rank 1 and above of the Ambassador Fellowship to be exceptional and only through a public referendum.
4.1.1,The Operation,Onboarding and Offboarding,Onboarding,59,"We need rank 0 registration onboarding for a new account to be either: i) through a current member at any rank above Rank 0, or ii) the account may self-onboard by verifying the on-chain identity of their account, and locking one DOT with that account using the `lock_dot` function in the ambassador-registration pallet."
4.1.1,The Operation,Onboarding and Offboarding,Onboarding,60,Rank 0 registration onboarding requires new account users to introduce themselves in an channel designated for the Ambassador Fellowship and have that verified by a verifier using the `verify_introduction` function in the ambassador-registration pallet.
4.1.1,The Operation,Onboarding and Offboarding,Onboarding,61,Rank 0 registration onboarding is only results in `RegistrationStatus::Complete` in ambassador-registration pallet when they have satisfied either 59 i) or 59 ii) plus satisfied 60.
4,The Operation,,,62,We need all ranks to reflect both the **experience** and **contributions** of account users to the ecosystem
"4, 6.2.1",The Operation,Rank Requirements,"Preliminary Ranks (no tiering system)
",63,"We need 1 preliminary rank in the Ambassador Fellowship, rank number 0."
"4, 6.2.2",The Operation,Rank Requirements,Active Ranks (with tiering systems),64,"We need 6 active ranks in the Ambassador Fellowship, starting with lowest rank number 1"
"4, 6.2.2",The Operation,Rank Requirements,Active Ranks (with tiering systems),65,Rank 0 does not have a tier
"4, 6.2.2",The Operation,Rank Requirements,Active Ranks (with tiering systems),66,Ranks 1-2 inclusive have Tier 1
"4, 6.2.2",The Operation,Rank Requirements,Active Ranks (with tiering systems),67,Ranks 3-4 inclusive have Tier 2
"4, 6.2.2",The Operation,Rank Requirements,Active Ranks (with tiering systems),68,Ranks 5-6 inclusive have Tier 3
4,The Operation,Rank Requirements,Active Ranks (with tiering systems),69,We need higher ranks to always have more voting weight.
4,The Operation,Rank Requirements,"Preliminary Ranks (no tiering system)
",70,Rank 0 does not have a voting weight.
4,The Operation,Rank Requirements,Active Ranks (with tiering systems),71,Rank 1 has a voting weight of 1.
4,The Operation,Rank Requirements,Active Ranks (with tiering systems),72,Rank 2 has a voting weight of 3.
4,The Operation,Rank Requirements,Active Ranks (with tiering systems),73,Rank 3 has a voting weight of 6.
4,The Operation,Rank Requirements,Active Ranks (with tiering systems),74,Rank 4 has a voting weight of 10.
4,The Operation,Rank Requirements,Active Ranks (with tiering systems),75,Rank 5 has a voting weight of 15.
4,The Operation,Rank Requirements,Active Ranks (with tiering systems),76,Rank 6 has a voting weight of 21.
4.1.2,The Operation,Onboarding and Offboarding,Offboarding,77,We need Ambassadors at any rank to be able to remove themselves from the Fellowship by unlocking their one DOT. Removal will be instant. The educational content on accomplishing this will be shared upon opening the programme.
4.1.2,The Operation,Onboarding and Offboarding,Offboarding,78,"We need for higher ranks, a mediation process to take place, where removal from the program happens based on a process that is active at any given moment. The details of this process can change and develop based on the current needs of the ecosystem."
4.2,The Operation,Promotion,,99,"We need an Ambassador at any rank to be able to request their promotion by following the promotion process:

- All Members of one rank higher than the current rank are invited to approve or reject the request.
- The window for voting is open for 28 days.
- Most rank-weighted votes must favour the approved promotion.
- Suppose no Members have a high enough rank to affirm the promotion (always the case for promotion to rank VI). In that case, a general referendum on the Polkadot governance system must be approved for the promotion.
- If the promotion is approved, their associated rank is incremented by one."
4.2,The Operation,Promotion,,100,"We need an Ambassador to be able to be promoted to the next rank, where you need a majority vote of ambassadors who are one rank higher than the current. For example:

- To become an Associate Ambassador from an Advocate Ambassador, there must be a majority vote of Associate Ambassador and above.
- To become a Lead Ambassador from an Advocate Ambassador, there must be a majority vote of Lead Ambassadors and above.
- To become a Global Head Ambassador, there must be a public referendum since no ranks higher.
- In the initial seeding phase, there may not be any individuals in some of the higher ranks. In this situation, there will also be a public referendum on promoting those without anyone ranking higher than them.

By majority vote, we mean those who vote within the Ambassador Fellowship, not all potential voters. We cannot expect everyone to turn out for every vote, though there are expectations that voting turnout should increase as individuals rise the ranks. A majority vote means that the vote concludes with more than a 50% approval rate."
4.3,The Operation,Vote Process,,101,"We need the Ambassador Fellowship to favour social consensus in its decision-making, using on-chain voting only in cases where a consensus cannot be reached. When voting is required, it will happen within the Ambassador Fellowship to reduce OpenGov solicitation as much as possible.

Decisions that Ambassadors may need to reach a consensus on via the voting system:

- Promotions and demotions
- Programme treasury spending
- Additions and removals
- Minor amendments to the manifesto

Should the Ambassador Fellowship require major changes, members can ratify the suggested changes using the fellowship-internal voting process. Non-members can only propose changes via the OpenGov root track."
4.4,The Operation,Demotion and Removal,,102,"We need to support the three schools of thought surrounding a process which demotes individuals from their rank:

1) Ranks are supposed to represent the acknowledgement of past actions and validation from the community to encourage an ambassador to continue on their way. Still, in no way is there a promise of future work or results and because there is no opportunity cost for the treasury to maintain less active Ambassadors in the program, it does not seem to welcome the design of an automatic demotion process.

2) A ranking system with demotion and clear metrics is a must. A percentage of people who reach this threshold will certainly turn against the Polkadot Network through some unavoidable circumstances - resentment, disillusionment, attracted by a competing chain. Suppose these people, particularly in the higher ranks, cannot be easily demoted or removed. In that case, the programme is exposed to the dangers of having negative influences within the ranks, which could impact both the collective's mood and Polkadot's external impression. This is particularly dangerous where there is a caveat that would allow returning ambassadors to be promoted to any level via governance [seeding].

3) Valuable Members could experience decay during times of necessary inactivity but be returned to their previous standing on return when deemed adequate. It would also seem more logical to have a stepped decay process than to apply the same 12-month criteria to everyone. A Global Ambassador may leave for 12 months, and it is unnecessary to demote them completely back to Advocate Ambassador; why not simply step them down individually. A stepped approach will lead to a more gradual journey, both encouraging more consistent engagement from people and less risk of completely demotivating the return of quality ambassadors who do not wish to start from scratch.

We need to support the broad spectrum nature of the Ambassador Fellowship that mandates that those in the programme should assess the need for a demotion framework upon its establishment. The three schools of thought should all have a place within the programme, and the lived experience should clarify what is necessary to encourage a culture of passion, dedication and openness within the Ambassador Fellowship and broader community. "
4.4,The Operation,Demotion and Removal,,103,"We need to ensure that protecting and driving forward a favourable reputation of Polkadot is a minimum expectation of individuals that join, and self-policing should occur naturally. "
4.4,The Operation,Demotion and Removal,,104,"We need to cater for if there is still a need for a clear demotion process, such that the fellowship can vote internally for an amendment to this manifesto."
4.4,The Operation,Demotion and Removal,,105,We need DOT token holders to be able to propose amendments through OpenGov via root referendum or request the demotion or revocation of any Ambassador at any time via the Fellowship admin track.
5.1,The Funding,Overview,,106,"We need the funding mechanism for the Ambassador Fellowship to operate independently from the programme itself—a deliberate design choice that adds resilience and clarity. By decoupling rank from financial compensation, we create a merit-based organisation where ranks have real meaning and substance. Ambassadors earn recognition based on their contributions, and only those who provide ongoing value are compensated using the different funding methods described below. This fosters a culture of high-quality, long-term participation within the ecosystem, where roles are not simply honorary but are tied directly to tangible impact. Holding a title does not guarantee rewards; only results do, but the title (rank) itself serves as an aid to achieve those results."
5.1,The Funding,Overview,,107,"We need the introduction of a new type of funding mechanism—the Optimistic Fund—to the ecosystem provides a structure designed to be flexible and scalable, ensuring the Ambassador Fellowship can grow without being constrained by rigid or outdated funding mechanisms. Compensation is allocated through pro-rata payments, which require votes to continue, ensuring that DOT token holders maintain complete control over how funds are spent. By adjusting how funds are managed—avoiding automatic payments, requiring memos for spending, setting more targeted budgets, and dynamically selecting Ambassadors on-chain we can reduce wasteful spending and diversify our investments into the ecosystem more effectively. This results in a more impactful, transparent use of resources.

This approach also brings security and limpidity to the program. DOT token holders have a direct say in how Ambassadors are funded, with decisions based on merit rather than fixed entitlements. Controlled budgets and clear reporting requirements ensure that every expenditure is justified and aligned with the community's evolving needs. This dynamic, on-chain selection adds another layer of security, ensuring that only the most qualified and effective contributors are rewarded and underperforming/bad actors can be quickly cut off from future funding.

We also create a resilient and future-proof program that can adapt to the Polkadot ecosystem’s ever-changing needs. This separation makes the Ambassador Fellowship more transparent and scalable and allows new programs to emerge, if necessary, with existing funding mechanisms.

For existing ambassadors, this shift in philosophy offers a more sustainable and impactful path forward. These pillars — merit-based recognition, responsible financial management and dynamic selection — represent a necessary evolution, allowing the Ambassador Fellowship to continue growing while ensuring that every contributor and every expenditure serves the long-term goals of the Polkadot ecosystem."
5.2,The Funding,Fellowship Ambassador Treasury,,108,"We need the Ambassador Fellowship programme to have an on-chain treasury. These treasury funds will be used to provide tooling for the Fellowship and cover any incidental costs. When the Fellowship is established, the top-up amount and frequency will be agile, depending on the need. The required funds and top-ups will be requested via OpenGov, based on the process set by the Ambassador Fellowship. The use of the funds once in the treasury will be decided through the internal Fellowship voting system.

Examples of how the treasury may be used:

- Tooling such as G-Suite, Element, Discord, premium membership for apps and social media channels
- Specialist merchandise for Ambassadors
- Operational emergencies

The treasury will not be used for:

- Salaries
- Tipping
- Specialist vertical (Section 6.2) funding
- Travel expenses
- Personal expenses"
5.3.1,The Funding,Optimistic Funding,Overview,109,"We need to establish a program based on optimistic funding that will ensure that the Polkadot ecosystem has immediate access to funds.

An optimistic funding scheme proposes that the main Polkadot Treasury periodically transfers a predetermined sum of funds, whether in DOT tokens or fiat denominations, to an agnostic 'optimistic treasury' on a pro-rata basis. We suggest that a sensible starting point would be to handle monthly funding requests and treasury top-ups. On this assumption, during the prior month, any person, group, or collective within the Polkadot ecosystem may request a portion of the following month's treasury to cover their needs for that period.

During each pro-rata period, the community can vote on which person, collective, or scheme each portion of the optimistic fund will be used to finance during the next allocation period. If voters choose not to cancel or alter their previous voting preference, their vote will continue indefinitely (as long as the same entity is requesting funding). This approach allows voters to redirect resources each interval without burdening the voter base, should they be satisfied with the status quo.

All ecosystem participants have the right to apply for Optimistic Treasury funding, and the token holders can vote for their preferred applicants. While funding requests are not restricted to Ambassador-related activities, if the program performs as intended, we expect the community to prioritise and allocate resources to the necessary elements to push the program forward (optimistically). We suggest using a Phragmén voting system to determine the allocation of the Optimistic Treasury pot, as explained in section 5.3.2.

Establishing a funding mechanism open to all ecosystem participants will ensure that both the funding mechanism and any Ambassador program remain as resilient as possible.

Establishing a funding mechanism can introduce significant social and programming complications and is often a major barrier to entry for new programs. Additionally, when a program is created with inbuilt funding, if the program fails, the funding mechanism is often rendered useless and collapses. The friction in creating funding mechanisms can often lead to programs continuing past their useful lifespan and also inhibit valuable new programs from materialising.

By decoupling the Ambassador program from this new optimistic funding mechanism, we hope to create an enduring program. Should the time come when the community decides that this version of the Ambassador program is no longer fit for purpose, we believe any subsequent community-supported program must be swiftly created and have immediate access to funding through the independent optimistic funding mechanism."
5.3.2,The Funding,Optimistic Funding,Phragmén Voting,110,"We need Phragmén Voting.

Definition: “Phragmén’s method seeks to solve the issue of electing a set of a given number of persons from a larger set of candidates. Phragmén discussed this in the context of a parliamentary election in a multi-member constituency; the same problem can, of course, also occur in local elections, but also in many other situations such as electing a board or a committee in an organisation”.

Purpose: The primary benefit of Phragmén voting is its ability to allocate votes and seats more proportionally and equitably, especially in multi-winner elections such as those that will occur with the Optimistic Treasury. Phragmén minimises the concentration of power, reduces tactical voting, and optimises vote allocation.

Also of key importance (1) it ensures diverse candidates are elected, reflecting both majority and minority support; (2) power is more evenly distributed, avoiding dominance by a single group; (3) Voters can express true preferences without needing to vote strategically (4) Votes are used optimally to maximise voter satisfaction across multiple candidates; (5) it is a scalable system — works well in complex elections and is transparent."
5.3.3,The Funding,Optimistic Funding,Ambassador Fellowship x Optimistic Fund Process,26,"We need each Optimistic Block (OpBlock) to be valued at $10,000."
5.3.3,The Funding,Optimistic Funding,Ambassador Fellowship x Optimistic Fund Process,27,"We need the community to vote periodically on how many OpBlox should be available each month, which will then be filled out automatically by the main Polkadot Treasury."
5.3.3,The Funding,Optimistic Funding,Ambassador Fellowship x Optimistic Fund Process,28,We need all DOT holders to be able to apply to the Optimistic Fund. The applicant should be from Rank I-VI for a proposal related to the Ambassador Fellowship programme.

6.2.1,The Ranking System,Ranking Requirements,Preliminary Ranks (no tiering system),127,"We need an Advocate Ambassador (Rank 0), where one absolute requirement for an individual to begin their journey with the Ambassador Fellowship is to be registered on-chain. To do this, they will take the following steps:

- Open a wallet, become verified, and lock 1 DOT.
- Introduce themselves in channels founded and designated for the Ambassador-ecosystem dialogue."
6.2.1,The Ranking System,Ranking Requirements,Preliminary Ranks (no tiering system),128,"We need to provide simple guidelines to walk individuals through each step of their onboarding to Rank 0, to ensure the barrier to entry makes this Fellowship accessible to all."
6.2.1,The Ranking System,Ranking Requirements,Preliminary Ranks (no tiering system),129,"We need Advocate Ambassadors who are newly engaged members of the Fellowship. This is when an individual embarks on their journey to learn about the Polkadot Network and becomes immersed in both the Fellowship and the broader Polkadot community.

6.3,The Ranking System,Metric Guidelines for Promotion,,133,"We need the success metrics used for promotion through the ranks to be flexible to align with the versatile and scalable nature of the Ambassador Fellowship and Polkadot's changing needs. To avoid overly rigid criteria, guidelines are provided to measure an individual's readiness for advancement and identify key engagement areas at each rank. As the Polkadot roadmap evolves, these areas may be adjusted accordingly.
"
6.3.1,The Ranking System,Metric Guidelines for Promotion,Overview,134,"We need six key areas of appraisal for promotion to exist. As individuals climb the ranks, they are assessed in more areas:

No.        Key Area of Appraisal        Expected At        Example Action
1        Online Engagement        Ranks I–VI        Community Forums and Chat Channels, Social Media, Podcasts, Live Spaces
2        Offline Engagement        Ranks II–VI        Event Attendance, Meetups, Hosting, Speaking
3        Governance        Ranks II–VI        OpenGov voting, Proposal Submission, Advocacy and Onboarding [retail and whales], Delegations

6        Executive Responsibilities and Mentorship        Ranks V–VI        Ambassador Fellowship Development, Polkadot Strategy, Governance Engagement"
6.3.1,The Ranking System,Metric Guidelines for Promotion,Overview,135,"We need each key appraisal area to be measured on a scale of 1—6 per the tiering system:

Category        Ranks        Description
[1 – Learners]        1–2        Listening, Learning and Demonstrating Understanding
[2 – Engagers]        3–4        Active Engagement
[3 – Drivers]        5–6        Leadership and Innovation"
6.3.2,The Ranking System,Metric Guidelines for Promotion,Promotion Examples,147,"We need the following key areas of appraisal:

Within the same tier: Rank I, Associate Ambassador to be promoted to Rank II, Lead Ambassador Key Areas of Appraisal:

Online Engagement — actions are meeting expectations at [A—Learner]2.
Offline Engagement — actions meeting expectations at [A—Learner]1.
Moving up a tier: Rank II, Lead Ambassador, to be promoted to Rank III, Senior Ambassador. Key Areas of Appraisal:

Online Engagement — actions are meeting expectations at [B—Engager]4.
Offline Engagement — actions meeting expectations at [B—Engager]3.
Governance — actions are meeting expectations at [B—Engager]3.
Community growth & sustainability — actions meeting expectations at [A_Learner]1."
6.4,The Ranking System,Rank-weighted Voting,,148,"We need voting to happen through rank-weighted voting. Ambassadors at Rank I, Advocate Ambassadors, will not be able to vote. Ambassadors at Rank I—VI, Associate Ambassador to Global Head Ambassador, will have their votes weighted as follows.

Rank        Name        Tier        Voting Weight

7,The Evaluation,,,149,"We need in the digital systems, for decisions to be designed to be straightforward and unambiguous."
7,The Evaluation,,,150,"We need to achieve consistent and fair judgments despite far more complex social systems like law, education, or corporate hierarchies. "
7,The Evaluation,,,151,"We need to achieve a delicate balance between the rule-makers intentions and the need for clarity that often proves elusive, as history has shown numerous failures to maintain it."
7,The Evaluation,,,152,"We need for our focus to be on the technical facets of blockchain technology, and at the same time it is essential for our focus to also recognize that not every decision can be made with pure objectivity when evaluating people. Human judgement is still crucial. To navigate this, we need to promote open discussion and provide a basic framework to guide voters consisting of two components:
- Broad considerations that apply across all ranks, and;
- Specialist verticals that serve Polkadot's evolving needs.

We need these verticals to mandate their deliverables and KPIs, operating as sub-programmes of the Ambassador Fellowship."
7.1.1,The Evaluation,Common Expectations,Ambassador Fellowship Contributions,136,"We need for each individual to be able to make a broad and constantly evolving range of contributions to promote the Polkadot Network. To be promoted through the ranks, however, requires increasing demands for input and participation. For example:

- Active Participation: plentiful teaching, education, and rational advocacy are crucial for advancement to higher ranks.
- Community Growth: the individual has actively promoted and grown the programme by recruiting, onboarding and assisting in Member promotions.
- Governance Engagement: Regular voting is required to facilitate efficient promotions and other voting mechanisms. Increased voting activity should be reflected in rank advancement.

Rank        Name        Tier        Voting Weight        Voting Attendance
0        Advocate Ambassador        n/a        n/a        n/a
I        Associate Ambassador        1        1        >30%
II        Lead Ambassador        1        3        >30%

V        Global Ambassador        3        15        >75%
VI        Global Head Ambassador        3        21        >90%"
7.1.2,The Evaluation,Common Expectations,Social Interactions,137,"We need to use these consideration points when evaluating social interactions with other members. These should be evaluated comparatively to other members already of the prospective rank.

- Effective Communication: The individual can listen, comprehend, and form a compelling dialogue.
- Constructive Engagement: The individual avoids ego, pointless argumentation, or repeatedly pushing a point that has been addressed.
- Critical Thinking: The individual is not afraid to calmly and succinctly challenge others when it would lead to a deeper understanding.
- Community Support: The individual is persistently and consistently available to support other community members."
7.2.1,The Evaluation,Specialist Verticals,Overview,138,"We need Functional Fellowships like the Ambassador Fellowship to consist of dynamic, self-organising groups with clear purpose, domain and accountabilities. Within these groups, individuals take on specific roles with defined scope, functions and contributions."
7.2.1,The Evaluation,Specialist Verticals,Overview,139,"We need The Ambassador Fellowship to be designed to be resilient and versatile, empowering its members to be creative in finding solutions and innovations that support the ever-evolving Polkadot Network."
7.2.1,The Evaluation,Specialist Verticals,Overview,140,"We need the framework to be broad enough to capture the skills and vision of many yet focused enough to ensure economic and social success while nurturing members to realise their ambitions as individual Ambassadors. The Ambassador Fellowship's vision, mission, actions and ranks are outlined. We need this framework to act by breathing life into specialist verticals with a defined purpose, dedicated Members and ambitious and achievable goals."
7.2.2,The Evaluation,Specialist Verticals,Principles,141,"We need the following principles:

- Clarity of purpose: Each specialist vertical must have a clear purpose statement that defines why it exists. The DIRECT guidelines should be followed during the design process.
    1. Dynamic: allows for fast feedback and iteration
    2. Inclusive: open to anyone to participate
    3. Resilient: adapts to challenges and remains effective
    4. Equitable: ensures fairness in the selection process
    5. Clear: places outcomes and transparency at the forefront
    6. Trustless: relies on on-chain mechanisms for transparency and scalability
- Role definition: define roles based on functions, not titles. Roles can evolve.
- Accountabilities and Metrics: each role has specific accountabilities. These are measurable outcomes or deliverables.
- Role evolution: roles and their responsibilities adapt as circumstances change. Regular role reviews ensure alignment with the vertical’s purpose.
- Role-filling and double-linking: individuals fill roles based on their skills and passions. Double-linking means connecting roles across groups to foster collaboration."
7.2.3,The Evaluation,Specialist Verticals,Example Verticals,142,"We need internally focused verticals including:

- Ambassador Development and Recognition — Investing in Ambassadors' personal and professional growth, making them key contributors to the Web3 space.
- Programme Impact and Success — Establishing a framework to assess the programme’s effectiveness and ensure continuous improvement.
- Recruitment and retention — Actively seeking to grow the programme and create a scheme that people want to work and grow within."
7.2.3,The Evaluation,Specialist Verticals,Example Verticals,143,"We need externally focused verticals including:

- Business Development tracks, such as Enterprise, Government, and Cross-Chain Partnerships
- Investor Relations tracks, including managing relationships with existing investors, attracting new capital to the Polkadot ecosystem by engaging targeted investors, and conducting related activities explicitly aimed at increasing capital flow into the ecosystem and driving buy-pressure on the DOT token.
- Education and Awareness. Enhancing understanding of Polkadot’s unique value propositions within the broader blockchain and Web3 communities
- Developer Recruitment and Onboarding
- Decentralisation and Governance Promoting Polkadot’s decentralized governance model and empowering communities to participate actively."
8,"Annexes, Clarifications and Amendments",,,31,"We need any Ambassador to be able to propose a clarification or an amendment to this manifesto. In line with the Polkadot Technical Fellowship manifesto, all proposals will be subject to a one-month challenge. During that time, a majority ranked-vote of the Ambassadors rank and above may vote to approve or reject the proposal. Pre-existing rules will always take precedence. Clarifications and amendments must not contravene established principles and standards.

If an Ambassador wants to propose an annex, this must be submitted through OpenGov as a root referendum. If a DOT holder who is not part of the Ambassador Fellowship does not want to join but wishes to propose an annex or any other changes, including closing down the Ambassador Fellowship, this must also be done through OpenGov as a root referendum."
9,Appendix,A,Philosophy and Principles of Polkadot,144,"We need:
- Enlightened Liberalism. Honesty and freedom. But respect, politeness and tolerance.
- Critical Rationalism. Judge only by actions, not suppositions, associations or words.
- Web 3. Provide individuals with tools to interact usefully with the world themselves, reducing their need to trust the group.
- Polkadot. Decentralised empowers the individual"
9,Appendix,B,Acknowledgements,145,"We need the manifesto to be the product of the diverse, passionate, vocal community that is Polkadot's heart."
9,Appendix,B,Acknowledgements,146,"We need to acknowledge the more significant contributions from within the ecosystem, but the finished article is a tapestry of expression from past, present, and future collaborators."
