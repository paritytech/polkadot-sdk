//! Cumulus timestamp related primitives.
//!
//! Provides a [`InherentDataProvider`] that should be used in the validation phase of the
//! parachain. It will be used to create the inherent data and that will be used to check the
//! inherents inside the parachain block (in this case the timestamp inherent). As we don't have
//! access to any clock from the runtime the timestamp is always passed as an inherent into the
//! runtime. To check this inherent when validating the block, we will use the relay chain slot. As
//! the relay chain slot is derived from a timestamp, we can easily convert it back to a timestamp
//! by muliplying it with the slot duration. By comparing the relay chain slot derived timestamp
//! with the timestamp we can ensure that the parachain timestamp is reasonable.
