//! Cumulus parachain inherent
//!
//! The [`ParachainInherentData`] is the data that is passed by the collator to the parachain
//! runtime. The runtime will use this data to execute messages from other parachains/the relay
//! chain or to read data from the relay chain state. When the parachain is validated by a parachain
//! validator on the relay chain, this data is checked for correctnes. If the data passed by the
//! collator to the runtime isn't correct, the parachain candidate is considered invalid.
//!
//! Use [`ParachainInherentData::create_at`] to create the [`ParachainInherentData`] at a given
//! relay chain block to include it in a parachain block.
