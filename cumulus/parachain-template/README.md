# Substrate Cumulus Parachain Template

A new [Cumulus](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/)-based Substrate node, ready for hacking ☁️..

This project is originally a fork of the
[Substrate Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template)
modified to include dependencies required for registering this node as a **parathread** or
**parachain** to a **relay chain**.

The stand-alone version of this template is hosted on the
[Substrate Devhub Parachain Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template/)
for each release of Polkadot. It is generated directly to the upstream
[Parachain Template in Cumulus](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/tree/master/parachain-template)
at each release branch using the
[Substrate Template Generator](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-template-generator/).

🧙 Learn about how to use this template and run your own parachain testnet for it in the
[Devhub Cumulus Tutorial](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/v3/cumulus/start-relay/).
