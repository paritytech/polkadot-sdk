# Polkadot Omni Node

This is a white labeled implementation based on [`polkadot-omni-node-lib`](https://crates.io/crates/polkadot-omni-node-lib).
It can be used to start a parachain node from a provided chain spec file. It is only compatible with runtimes that use block
number `u32` and `Aura` consensus.

## Installation

Download & expose it via `PATH`:

```bash
# Download and set it on PATH.
wget https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/releases/download/<stable_release_tag>/polkadot-omni-node
chmod +x polkadot-omni-node
export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`"
```

Compile & install via `cargo`:

```bash
# Assuming ~/.cargo/bin is on the PATH
cargo install polkadot-omni-node --locked
```

## Usage

A basic example for an Omni Node run starts from a runtime which implements the [`sp_genesis_builder::GenesisBuilder`](https://docs.rs/sp-genesis-builder/latest/sp_genesis_builder/trait.GenesisBuilder.html).
The interface mandates the runtime to expose a [`named-preset`](https://docs.rs/staging-chain-spec-builder/latest/staging_chain_spec_builder/#generate-chain-spec-using-runtime-provided-genesis-config-preset).

### 1. Install chain-spec-builder

**Note**: `chain-spec-builder` binary is published on [`crates.io`](https://crates.io) under
[`staging-chain-spec-builder`](https://crates.io/crates/staging-chain-spec-builder) due to a name conflict.
Install it with `cargo` like bellow :

```bash
cargo install staging-chain-spec-builder --locked
```

### 2. Generate a chain spec

Omni Node requires the chain spec to include a JSON key named `relay_chain`. It is set to a chain id,
representing the chain name, e.g. `westend`, `paseo`, `rococo`, `polkadot`, or `kusama`, but
there are also local variants that can be used for testing, like `rococo-local` or `westend-local`. The
local variants are available only for a build of `polkadot-omni-node` with
`westend-native` and `rococo-native` features respectively.

Additionaly, although deprecated, the `--para-id` flag can still be used to set the JSON key named
`para_id`. The removal of the flag will happen starting with `stable2512`. The alternative of not using
it is to implement the `cumulus_primitives_core::GetParachainInfo` runtime API for the runtime, and
upgrade it on-chain as well, to be compatible with nodes released starting with `stable2512`.

Example command bellow:

```bash
chain-spec-builder create --relay-chain <relay_chain_id> --para-id <id> -r <runtime.wasm> named-preset <preset_name>
```

### 3. Run Omni Node

And now with the generated chain spec we can start the node in development mode like so:

```bash
polkadot-omni-node --dev --chain <chain_spec.json>
```
