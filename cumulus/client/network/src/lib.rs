/// of blocks per round, which is clearly not doable.
///
/// To solve this problem, each block announcement is delayed until a collator
/// has received a [`Statement::Seconded`] for its `PoV`. This message tells the
/// collator that its `PoV` was validated successfully by a parachain validator and
/// that it is very likely that this `PoV` will be included in the relay chain. Every
/// collator that doesn't receive the message for its `PoV` will not announce its block.
/// For more information on the block announcement, see [`WaitToAnnounce`].
///
/// For each block announcement that is received, the generic block announcement validation
/// will call this validator and provides the extra data that was attached to the announcement.
/// We call this extra data `justification`.
/// It is expected that the attached data is a SCALE encoded [`BlockAnnounceData`]. The
/// statement is checked to be a [`CompactStatement::Seconded`] and that it is signed by an active
/// parachain validator.
///
/// If no justification was provided we check if the block announcement is at the tip of the known
/// chain. If it is at the tip, it is required to provide a justification or otherwise we reject
/// it. However, if the announcement is for a block below the tip the announcement is accepted
/// as it probably comes from a node that is currently syncing the chain.
