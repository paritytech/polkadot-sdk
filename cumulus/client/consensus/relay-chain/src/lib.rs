//! The relay-chain provided consensus algorithm for parachains.
//!
//! This is the simplest consensus algorithm you can use when developing a parachain. It is a
//! permission-less consensus algorithm that doesn't require any staking or similar to join as a
//! collator. In this algorithm the consensus is provided by the relay-chain. This works in the
//! following way.
//!
//! 1. Each node that sees itself as a collator is free to build a parachain candidate.
//!
//! 2. This parachain candidate is send to the parachain validators that are part of the relay
//! chain.
//!
//! 3. The parachain validators validate at most X different parachain candidates, where X is the
//! total number of parachain validators.
//!
//! 4. The parachain candidate that is backed by the most validators is chosen by the relay-chain
//! block producer to be added as backed candidate on chain.
//!
//! 5. After the parachain candidate got backed and included, all collators start at 1.
