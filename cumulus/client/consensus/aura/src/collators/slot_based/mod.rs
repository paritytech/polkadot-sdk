//! A collator for Aura that looks ahead of the most recently included parachain block
//! when determining what to build upon.
//!
//! The block building mechanism consists of two parts:
//! 	1. A block-builder task that builds parachain blocks at each of our slots.
//! 	2. A collator task that transforms the blocks into a collation and submits them to the relay
//!     chain.
//!
//! Blocks are built on every parachain slot if there is a core scheduled on the relay chain. At the
//! beginning of each block building loop, we determine how many blocks we expect to build per relay
//! chain block. The collator implementation then expects that we have that many cores scheduled
//! during the relay chain block. After the block is built, the block builder task sends it to
//! the collation task which compresses it and submits it to the collation-generation subsystem.
