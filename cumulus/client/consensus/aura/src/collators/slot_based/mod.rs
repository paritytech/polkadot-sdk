//! # Architecture Overview
//!
//! The block building mechanism operates through two coordinated tasks:
//!
//! 1. **Block Builder Task**: Orchestrates the timing and execution of parachain block production
//! 2. **Collator Task**: Processes built blocks into collations for relay chain submission
//!
//! # Block Builder Task Details
//!
//! The block builder task manages block production timing and execution through an iterative
//! process:
//!
//! 1. Awaits the next production signal from the internal timer
//! 2. Retrieves the current best relay chain block and identifies a valid parent block (see
//!    [find_potential_parents][cumulus_client_consensus_common::find_potential_parents] for parent
//!    selection criteria)
//! 3. Validates that:
//!    - The parachain has an assigned core on the relay chain
//!    - No block has been previously built on the target core
//! 4. Executes block building and import operations
//! 5. Transmits the completed block to the collator task
//!
//! # Block Production Timing
//!
//! When a block is produced is determined by the following parameters:
//!
//! - Parachain slot duration
//! - Number of assigned parachain cores
//! - Parachain runtime configuration
//!
//! ## Timing Examples
//!
//! The following table demonstrates various timing configurations and their effects. The "AURA
//! Slot" column shows which author is responsible for the block.
//!
//! | Slot Duration (ms) | Cores | Production Attempts (ms) | AURA Slot  |
//! |-------------------|--------|-------------------------|------------|
//! | 2000              | 3      | 0, 2000, 4000, 6000    | 0, 1, 2, 3 |
//! | 6000              | 1      | 0, 6000, 12000, 18000  | 0, 1, 2, 3 |
//! | 6000              | 3      | 0, 2000, 4000, 6000    | 0, 0, 0, 1 |
//! | 12000             | 1      | 0, 6000, 12000, 18000  | 0, 0, 1, 1 |
//! | 12000             | 3      | 0, 2000, 4000, 6000    | 0, 0, 0, 0 |
//!
//! # Collator Task Details
//!
//! The collator task receives built blocks from the block builder task and performs two primary
//! functions:
//!
//! 1. Block compression
//! 2. Submission to the collation-generation subsystem
