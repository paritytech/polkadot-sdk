Description: While relayer is active, we only sync mandatory and required Rococo (and Rococo BH) headers to Westend BH.
Network: ../environments/rococo-westend/bridge_hub_westend_local_network.toml
Creds: config

# step 1: initialize Westend AH
asset-hub-westend-collator1: run ../scripts/invoke-script.sh with "init-asset-hub-westend-local" within 60 seconds

# step 2: initialize Westend bridge hub
bridge-hub-westend-collator1: run ../scripts/invoke-script.sh with "init-bridge-hub-westend-local" within 60 seconds

# step 3: ensure that initialization has completed
asset-hub-westend-collator1: js-script ../js-helpers/wait-hrmp-channel-opened.js with "1002" within 600 seconds

# step 4: send message from Westend to Rococo
asset-hub-westend-collator1: run ../scripts/invoke-script.sh with "reserve-transfer-assets-from-asset-hub-westend-local" within 60 seconds

# step 5: start relayer
# (we are starting it after sending the message to be sure that relayer won't relay messages before our js script
# will be started at step 6)
# (it is started by sibling 0003-required-headers-synced-while-active-westend-to-rococo.zndsl)

# step 6: ensure that relayer won't sync any extra headers while delivering messages and confirmations
bridge-hub-westend-collator1: js-script ../js-helpers/only-required-headers-synced-when-active.js with "500,rococo-at-westend" within 600 seconds

# wait until other network test has completed OR exit with an error too
asset-hub-westend-collator1: run ../scripts/sync-exit.sh within 600 seconds
