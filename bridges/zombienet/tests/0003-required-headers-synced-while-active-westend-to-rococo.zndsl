Description: While relayer is active, we only sync mandatory and required Westend (and Westend BH) headers to Rococo BH.

# step 1: initialize Rococo AH
asset-hub-rococo-collator1: run ../scripts/invoke-script.sh with "init-asset-hub-rococo-local" within 60 seconds

# step 2: initialize Rococo bridge hub
bridge-hub-rococo-collator1: run ../scripts/invoke-script.sh with "init-bridge-hub-rococo-local" within 60 seconds

# step 3: ensure that initialization has completed
asset-hub-rococo-collator1: js-script ../helpers/wait-hrmp-channel-opened.js with "1013" within 600 seconds

# step 4: send message from Rococo to Westend
asset-hub-rococo-collator1: run ../scripts/invoke-script.sh with "reserve-transfer-assets-from-asset-hub-rococo-local" within 60 seconds

# step 5: start relayer
# (we are starting it after sending the message to be sure that relayer won't relay messages before our js script
# will be started at step 6)
bridge-hub-rococo-collator1: run ../scripts/start-relayer.sh within 60 seconds

# step 6: ensure that relayer won't sync any extra headers while delivering messages and confirmations
bridge-hub-rococo-collator1: js-script ../helpers/only-required-headers-synced-when-active.js with "500,westend-at-rococo" within 600 seconds

# wait until other network test has completed OR exit with an error too
asset-hub-rococo-collator1: run ../scripts/sync-exit.sh within 600 seconds
