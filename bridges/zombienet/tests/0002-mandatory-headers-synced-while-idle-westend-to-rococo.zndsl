Description: While relayer is idle, we only sync mandatory Westend (and a single Westend BH) headers to Rococo BH.

# step 1: initialize Rococo bridge hub
bridge-hub-rococo-collator1: run ../scripts/invoke-script.sh with "init-bridge-hub-rococo-local" within 60 seconds

# step 2: sleep some time before starting relayer. We want to sleep for at least 1 session, which is expected to
# be 60 seconds for test environment.
sleep 120 seconds

# step 3: start relayer

# it also takes some time for relayer to initialize bridge, so let's sleep for 5 minutes to be sure that parachain
# header has been synced

# step 4: ensure that relayer is only syncing mandatory headers while idle. This includes both headers that were
# born while relay was offline and those in the next 100 seconds while script is active.
