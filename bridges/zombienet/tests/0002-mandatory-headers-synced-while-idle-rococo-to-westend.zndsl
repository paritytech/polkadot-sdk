Description: While relayer is idle, we only sync mandatory Rococo (and a single Rococo BH) headers to Westend BH.

# step 1: initialize Westend bridge hub
bridge-hub-westend-collator1: run ../scripts/invoke-script.sh with "init-bridge-hub-westend-local" within 60 seconds

# step 2: sleep some time before starting relayer. We want to sleep for at least 1 session, which is expected to
# be 60 seconds for test environment.
sleep 120 seconds

# step 3: start relayer
# (it is started by the sibling 0002-mandatory-headers-synced-while-idle-westend-to-rococo.zndsl test file)

# it also takes some time for relayer to initialize bridge, so let's sleep for 5 minutes to be sure that parachain
# header has been synced

# step 4: ensure that relayer is only syncing mandatory headers while idle. This includes both headers that were
# born while relay was offline and those in the next 100 seconds while script is active.
