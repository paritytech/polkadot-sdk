// Normal transactions have limit of 75% of 1/2 second weight for Cumulus parachains. Let's keep
// some reserve for the rest of stuff there => let's select values that fit in 50% of maximal limit.

// Using current constants, the limit would be:
//
// `75% * WEIGHT_REF_TIME_PER_SECOND * 1 / 2 * 50% = 0.75 * 1_000_000_000_000 / 2 * 0.5 =
// 187_500_000_000`
//
// According to (preliminary) weights of messages pallet, cost of additional message is zero and the
// cost of additional relayer is `8_000_000 + db read + db write`. Let's say we want no more than
// 4096 unconfirmed messages (no any scientific justification for that - it just looks large
// enough). And then we can't have more than 4096 relayers. E.g. for 1024 relayers is (using
// `RocksDbWeight`):
//
// `1024 * (8_000_000 + db read + db write) = 1024 * (8_000_000 + 25_000_000 + 100_000_000) =
// 136_192_000_000`
//
// So 1024 looks like good approximation for the number of relayers. If something is wrong in those
// assumptions, or something will change, it shall be caught by the
// `ensure_able_to_receive_confirmation` test.
