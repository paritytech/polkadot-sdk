//! Module that adds XCM support to bridge pallets. The pallet allows to dynamically
//! open and close bridges between local (to this pallet location) and remote XCM
//! destinations.
//!
//! The `pallet_xcm_bridge_hub` pallet is used to manage (open, close) bridges between chains from
//! different consensuses. The new extrinsics `fn open_bridge` and `fn close_bridge` are introduced.
//! Other chains can manage channels with different bridged global consensuses.
//!
//! # Concept of `lane` and `LaneId`
//!
//! There is another `pallet_bridge_messages` pallet that handles inbound/outbound lanes for
//! messages. Each lane is a unique connection between two chains from different consensuses and is
//! identified by `LaneId`. `LaneId` is generated once when a new bridge is requested by `fn
//! open_bridge`. It is generated by `BridgeLocations::calculate_lane_id` based on the following
//! parameters:
//! - Source `bridge_origin_universal_location` (latest XCM)
//! - Destination `bridge_destination_universal_location` (latest XCM)
//! - XCM version (both sides of the bridge must use the same parameters to generate the same
//!   `LaneId`)
//!   - `bridge_origin_universal_location`, `bridge_destination_universal_location` is converted to
//!     the `Versioned*` structs
//!
//! `LaneId` is expected to never change because:
//! - We need the same `LaneId` on both sides of the bridge, as `LaneId` is part of the message key
//!   proofs.
//! - Runtime upgrades are entirely asynchronous.
//! - We already have a running production Polkadot/Kusama bridge that uses `LaneId([0, 0, 0, 0])`.
//!
//! `LaneId` is backward compatible, meaning it can be encoded/decoded from the older format `[u8;
//! 4]` used for static lanes, as well as the new format `H256` generated by
//! `BridgeLocations::calculate_lane_id`.
//!
//! # Concept of `bridge` and `BridgeId`
//!
//! The `pallet_xcm_bridge_hub` pallet needs to store some metadata about opened bridges. The bridge
//! (or bridge metadata) is stored under the `BridgeId` key.
//!
//! `BridgeId` is generated from `bridge_origin_relative_location` and
//! `bridge_origin_universal_location` using the `latest` XCM structs. `BridgeId` is not transferred
//! over the bridge; it is only important for local consensus. It essentially serves as an index/key
//! to bridge metadata. All the XCM infrastructure around `XcmExecutor`, `SendXcm`, `ExportXcm` use
//! the `latest` XCM, so `BridgeId` must remain compatible with the `latest` XCM. For example, we
//! have an `ExportXcm` implementation in `exporter.rs` that handles the `ExportMessage` instruction
//! with `universal_source` and `destination` (latest XCM), so we need to create `BridgeId` and the
//! corresponding `LaneId`.
//!
//! # Migrations and State
//!
//! This pallet implements `try_state`, ensuring compatibility and checking everything so we know if
//! any migration is needed. `do_try_state` checks for `BridgeId` compatibility, which is
//! recalculated on runtime upgrade. Upgrading to a new XCM version should not break anything,
//! except removing older XCM versions. In such cases, we need to add migration for `BridgeId` and
//! stored `Versioned*` structs and update `LaneToBridge` mapping, but this won't affect `LaneId`
//! over the bridge.
//!
//! # How to Open a Bridge?
//!
//! The `pallet_xcm_bridge_hub` pallet has the extrinsic `fn open_bridge` and an important
//! configuration `pallet_xcm_bridge_hub::Config::OpenBridgeOrigin`, which translates the call's
//! origin to the XCM `Location` and converts it to the `bridge_origin_universal_location`. With the
//! current setup, this origin/location is expected to be either the relay chain or a sibling
//! parachain as one side of the bridge. Another parameter is
//! `bridge_destination_universal_location`, which is the other side of the bridge from a different
//! global consensus.
//!
//! Every bridge between two XCM locations has a dedicated lane in associated
//! messages pallet. Assuming that this pallet is deployed at the bridge hub
//! parachain and there's a similar pallet at the bridged network, the dynamic
//! bridge lifetime is as follows:
//!
//! 1) the sibling parachain opens a XCMP channel with this bridge hub;
//!
//! 2) the sibling parachain funds its sovereign parachain account at this bridge hub. It shall hold
//!    enough funds to pay for the bridge (see `BridgeDeposit`);
//!
//! 3) the sibling parachain opens the bridge by sending XCM `Transact` instruction with the
//!    `open_bridge` call. The `BridgeDeposit` amount is reserved on the sovereign account of
//!    sibling parachain;
//!
//! 4) at the other side of the bridge, the same thing (1, 2, 3) happens. Parachains that need to
//!    connect over the bridge need to coordinate the moment when they start sending messages over
//!    the bridge. Otherwise they may lose messages and/or bundled assets;
//!
//! 5) when either side wants to close the bridge, it sends the XCM `Transact` with the
//!    `close_bridge` call. The bridge is closed immediately if there are no queued messages.
//!    Otherwise, the owner must repeat the `close_bridge` call to prune all queued messages first.
//!
//! The pallet doesn't provide any mechanism for graceful closure, because it always involves
//! some contract between two connected chains and the bridge hub knows nothing about that. It
//! is the task for the connected chains to make sure that all required actions are completed
//! before the closure. In the end, the bridge hub can't even guarantee that all messages that
//! are delivered to the destination, are processed in the way their sender expects. So if we
//! can't guarantee that, we shall not care about more complex procedures and leave it to the
//! participating parties.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! Example of opening a bridge between some random parachains from Polkadot and Kusama:
//!
//! 0. Let's have:
//! 	- BridgeHubPolkadot with `UniversalLocation` = `[GlobalConsensus(Polkadot), Parachain(1002)]`
//! 	- BridgeHubKusama with `UniversalLocation` = `[GlobalConsensus(Kusama), Parachain(1002)]`
//! 1. The Polkadot local sibling parachain `Location::new(1, Parachain(1234))` must send some DOTs
//!    to its sovereign account on BridgeHubPolkadot to cover `BridgeDeposit`, fees for `Transact`,
//!    and the existential deposit.
//! 2. Send a call to the BridgeHubPolkadot from the local sibling parachain: `Location::new(1,
//!    Parachain(1234))` ``` xcm::Transact( origin_kind: OriginKind::Xcm,
//!    XcmOverBridgeHubKusama::open_bridge( VersionedInteriorLocation::V4([GlobalConsensus(Kusama),
//!    Parachain(4567)].into()), ); ) ```
//! 3. Check the stored bridge metadata and generated `LaneId`.
//! 4. The Kusama local sibling parachain `Location::new(1, Parachain(4567))` must send some KSMs to
//!    its sovereign account
//! on BridgeHubKusama to cover `BridgeDeposit`, fees for `Transact`, and the existential deposit.
//! 5. Send a call to the BridgeHubKusama from the local sibling parachain: `Location::new(1,
//!    Parachain(4567))` ``` xcm::Transact( origin_kind: OriginKind::Xcm,
//!    XcmOverBridgeHubKusama::open_bridge(
//!    VersionedInteriorLocation::V4([GlobalConsensus(Polkadot), Parachain(1234)].into()), ); ) ```
//! 6. Check the stored bridge metadata and generated `LaneId`.
//! 7. Both `LaneId`s from steps 3 and 6 must be the same (see above _Concept of `lane` and
//!    `LaneId`_).
//! 8. Run the bridge messages relayer for `LaneId`.
//! 9. Send messages from both sides.
//!
//! The opening bridge holds the configured `BridgeDeposit` from the origin's sovereign account, but
//! this deposit is returned when the bridge is closed with `fn close_bridge`.
