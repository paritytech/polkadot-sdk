//! # Staking Module
//!
//! The Staking module is used to manage funds at stake by network maintainers.
//!
//! - [`staking::Trait`](./trait.Trait.html)
//! - [`Call`](./enum.Call.html)
//! - [`Module`](./struct.Module.html)
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The Staking module is the means by which a set of network maintainers (known as _authorities_ in some contexts
//! and _validators_ in others) are chosen based upon those who voluntarily place funds under deposit. Under deposit,
//! those funds are rewarded under normal operation but are held at pain of _slash_ (expropriation) should the
//! staked maintainer be found not to be discharging its duties properly.
//!
//! ### Terminology
//! <!-- Original author of paragraph: @gavofyork -->
//!
//! - Staking: The process of locking up funds for some time, placing them at risk of slashing (loss)
//! in order to become a rewarded maintainer of the network.
//! - Validating: The process of running a node to actively maintain the network, either by producing
//! blocks or guaranteeing finality of the chain.
//! - Nominating: The process of placing staked funds behind one or more validators in order to share
//! in any reward, and punishment, they take.
//! - Stash account: The account holding an owner's funds used for staking.
//! - Controller account: The account that controls an owner's funds for staking.
//! - Era: A (whole) number of sessions, which is the period that the validator set (and each validator's
//! active nominator set) is recalculated and where rewards are paid out.
//! - Slash: The punishment of a staker by reducing its funds.
//!
//! ### Goals
//! <!-- Original author of paragraph: @gavofyork -->
//!
//! The staking system in Substrate NPoS is designed to make the following possible:
//!
//! - Stake funds that are controlled by a cold wallet.
//! - Withdraw some, or deposit more, funds without interrupting the role of an entity.
//! - Switch between roles (nominator, validator, idle) with minimal overhead.
//!
//! ### Scenarios
//!
//! #### Staking
//!
//! Almost any interaction with the Staking module requires a process of _**bonding**_ (also known as
//! being a _staker_). To become *bonded*, a fund-holding account known as the _stash account_, which holds
//! some or all of the funds that become frozen in place as part of the staking process, is paired with an
//! active **controller** account, which issues instructions on how they shall be used.
//!
//! An account pair can become bonded using the [`bond`](./enum.Call.html#variant.bond) call.
//!
//! Stash accounts can change their associated controller using the
//! [`set_controller`](./enum.Call.html#variant.set_controller) call.
//!
//! There are three possible roles that any staked account pair can be in: `Validator`, `Nominator` and `Idle`
//! (defined in [`StakerStatus`](./enum.StakerStatus.html)). There are three corresponding instructions to change between roles, namely:
//! [`validate`](./enum.Call.html#variant.validate), [`nominate`](./enum.Call.html#variant.nominate),
//! and [`chill`](./enum.Call.html#variant.chill).
//!
//! #### Validating
//!
//! A **validator** takes the role of either validating blocks or ensuring their finality, maintaining the veracity of
//! the network. A validator should avoid both any sort of malicious misbehavior and going offline.
//! Bonded accounts that state interest in being a validator do NOT get immediately chosen as a validator. Instead, they
//! are declared as a _candidate_ and they _might_ get elected at the _next era_ as a validator. The result of the
//! election is determined by nominators and their votes.
//!
//! An account can become a validator candidate via the [`validate`](./enum.Call.html#variant.validate) call.
//!
//! #### Nomination
//!
//! A **nominator** does not take any _direct_ role in maintaining the network, instead, it votes on a set of validators
//! to be elected. Once interest in nomination is stated by an account, it takes effect at the next election round. The
//! funds in the nominator's stash account indicate the _weight_ of its vote.
//! Both the rewards and any punishment that a validator earns are shared between the validator and its nominators.
//! This rule incentivizes the nominators to NOT vote for the misbehaving/offline validators as much as possible, simply
//! because the nominators will also lose funds if they vote poorly.
//!
//! An account can become a nominator via the [`nominate`](enum.Call.html#variant.nominate) call.
//!
//! #### Rewards and Slash
//!
//! The **reward and slashing** procedure is the core of the Staking module, attempting to _embrace valid behavior_
//! while _punishing any misbehavior or lack of availability_.
//!
//! Slashing can occur at any point in time, once misbehavior is reported. Once slashing is determined, a value is
//! deducted from the balance of the validator and all the nominators who voted for this validator
//! (values are deducted from the _stash_ account of the slashed entity).
//!
//! Similar to slashing, rewards are also shared among a validator and its associated nominators.
//! Yet, the reward funds are not always transferred to the stash account and can be configured.
//! See [Reward Calculation](#reward-calculation) for more details.
//!
//! #### Chilling
//!
//! Finally, any of the roles above can choose to step back temporarily and just chill for a while. This means that if
//! they are a nominator, they will not be considered as voters anymore and if they are validators, they will no longer
//! be a candidate for the next election.
//!
//! An account can step back via the [`chill`](enum.Call.html#variant.chill) call.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! The dispatchable functions of the Staking module enable the steps needed for entities to accept and change their
//! role, alongside some helper functions to get/set the metadata of the module.
//!
//! ### Public Functions
//!
//! The Staking module contains many public storage items and (im)mutable functions.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ### Example: Reporting Misbehavior
//!
//! ```
//! use srml_support::{decl_module, dispatch::Result};
//! use system::ensure_signed;
//! use srml_staking::{self as staking};
//!
//! pub trait Trait: staking::Trait {}
//!
//! decl_module! {
//! 	pub struct Module<T: Trait> for enum Call where origin: T::Origin {
//!			/// Report whoever calls this function as offline once.
//! 		pub fn report_sender(origin) -> Result {
//! 			let reported = ensure_signed(origin)?;
//! 			<staking::Module<T>>::on_offline_validator(reported, 1);
//! 			Ok(())
//! 		}
//! 	}
//! }
//! # fn main() { }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Implementation Details
//!
//! ### Slot Stake
//!
//! The term [`SlotStake`](./struct.Module.html#method.slot_stake) will be used throughout this section. It refers
//! to a value calculated at the end of each era, containing the _minimum value at stake among all validators._
//! Note that a validator's value at stake might be a combination of The validator's own stake
//! and the votes it received. See [`Exposure`](./struct.Exposure.html) for more details.
//!
//! ### Reward Calculation
//!
//! Rewards are recorded **per-session** and paid **per-era**. The value of the reward for each session is calculated at
//! the end of the session based on the timeliness of the session, then accumulated to be paid later. The value of
//! the new _per-session-reward_ is calculated at the end of each era by multiplying `SlotStake` and `SessionReward`
//! (`SessionReward` is the multiplication factor, represented by a number between 0 and 1).
//! Once a new era is triggered, rewards are paid to the validators and their associated nominators.
//!
//! The validator can declare an amount, named
//! [`validator_payment`](./struct.ValidatorPrefs.html#structfield.validator_payment), that does not get shared
//! with the nominators at each reward payout through its [`ValidatorPrefs`](./struct.ValidatorPrefs.html). This value
//! gets deducted from the total reward that can be paid. The remaining portion is split among the validator and all
//! of the nominators that nominated the validator, proportional to the value staked behind this validator (_i.e._
//! dividing the [`own`](./struct.Exposure.html#structfield.own) or [`others`](./struct.Exposure.html#structfield.others)
//! by [`total`](./struct.Exposure.html#structfield.total) in [`Exposure`](./struct.Exposure.html)).
//!
//! All entities who receive a reward have the option to choose their reward destination
//! through the [`Payee`](./struct.Payee.html) storage item (see [`set_payee`](enum.Call.html#variant.set_payee)),
//! to be one of the following:
//!
//! - Controller account, (obviously) not increasing the staked value.
//! - Stash account, not increasing the staked value.
//! - Stash account, also increasing the staked value.
//!
//! ### Slashing details
//!
//! A validator can be _reported_ to be offline at any point via the public function
//! [`on_offline_validator`](enum.Call.html#variant.on_offline_validator). Each validator declares how many times it
//! can be _reported_ before it actually gets slashed via its
//! [`unstake_threshold`](./struct.ValidatorPrefs.html#structfield.unstake_threshold).
//!
//! On top of this, the Staking module also introduces an
//! [`OfflineSlashGrace`](./struct.Module.html#method.offline_slash_grace), which applies
//! to all validators and prevents them from getting immediately slashed.
//!
//! Essentially, a validator gets slashed once they have been reported more than
//! [`OfflineSlashGrace`] + [`unstake_threshold`] times. Getting slashed due to offline report always leads
//! to being _unstaked_ (_i.e._ removed as a validator candidate) as the consequence.
//!
//! The base slash value is computed _per slash-event_ by multiplying
//! [`OfflineSlash`](./struct.Module.html#method.offline_slash) and the `total` `Exposure`. This value is then
//! multiplied by `2.pow(unstake_threshold)` to obtain the final slash value. All individual accounts' punishments are
//! capped at their total stake (NOTE: This cap should never come into force in a correctly implemented,
//! non-corrupted, well-configured system).
//!
//! ### Additional Fund Management Operations
//!
//! Any funds already placed into stash can be the target of the following operations:
//!
//! The controller account can free a portion (or all) of the funds using the [`unbond`](enum.Call.html#variant.unbond)
//! call. Note that the funds are not immediately accessible. Instead, a duration denoted by
//! [`BondingDuration`](./struct.BondingDuration.html) (in number of eras) must pass until the funds can actually be
//! removed. Once the `BondingDuration` is over, the [`withdraw_unbonded`](./enum.Call.html#variant.withdraw_unbonded) call can be used
//! to actually withdraw the funds.
//!
//! ### Election Algorithm
//!
//! The current election algorithm is implemented based on Phragmén.
//! The reference implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/w3f/consensus/tree/master/NPoS).
//!
//! The election algorithm, aside from electing the validators with the most stake value and votes, tries to divide
//! the nominator votes among candidates in an equal manner. To further assure this, an optional post-processing
//! can be applied that iteractively normalizes the nominator staked values until the total difference among
//! votes of a particular nominator are less than a threshold.
//!
//! ## GenesisConfig
//!
//! The Staking module depends on the [`GenesisConfig`](./struct.GenesisConfig.html).
//!
//! ## Related Modules
//!
//! - [Balances](../srml_balances/index.html): Used to manage values at stake.
//! - [Session](../srml_session/index.html): Used to manage sessions. Also, a list of new validators is
//! stored in the Session module's `Validators` at the end of each era.
