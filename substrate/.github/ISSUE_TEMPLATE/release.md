title: Release failure for {{ ref }}
---

Pipeline for release {{ ref }} failed. Please investigate.

If the pipeline has failed before pushing to crates.io, delete the release tag
and fix the release as necessary, retagging after complete. If the pipeline has
failed after pushing to crates.io, create a new tag incrementing the version.
