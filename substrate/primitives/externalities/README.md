Substrate externalities abstraction

The externalities mainly provide access to storage and to registered extensions. Extensions
are for example the keystore or the offchain externalities. These externalities are used to
access the node from the runtime via the runtime interfaces.

This crate exposes the main [`Externalities`] trait.
