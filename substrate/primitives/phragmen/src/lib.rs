//! Rust implementation of the Phragm√©n election algorithm. This is used in several pallets to
//! optimally distribute the weight of a set of voters among an elected set of candidates. In the
//! context of staking this is mapped to validators and nominators.
//!
//! The algorithm has two phases:
//!   - Sequential phragmen: performed in [`elect`] function which is first pass of the distribution
//!     The results are not optimal but the execution time is less.
//!   - Equalize post-processing: tries to further distribute the weight fairly among candidates.
//!     Incurs more execution time.
//!
//! The main objective of the assignments done by phragmen is to maximize the minimum backed
//! candidate in the elected set.
//!
//! Reference implementation: https://github.com/w3f/consensus
//! Further details:
//! https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/NPoS/4.%20Sequential%20Phragm%C3%A9n%E2%80%99s%20method/
