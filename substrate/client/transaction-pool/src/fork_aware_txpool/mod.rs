//! Substrate fork aware transaction pool implementation.
//!
//! # Top level overview.
//! This documentation provides high level overview of the main structures and the main flows within
//! the fork-aware transaction pool.
//!
//! ## Structures.
//! ### View.
//! #### Purpose.
//! The main responsibility of the [`View`] is to provide the valid set of ready transactions at
//! the given block. [`ForkAwareTxPool`] keeps the number of recent views for all the blocks
//! notified since recently finalized block.
//!
//! The views associated with blocks at the tips of the forks are actively updated with all newly
//! incoming transactions, while intermediate views are not updated (they still provide transactions
//! ready to be included at that block) due to performance reasons, since every transaction
//! submitted to the view needs to be [validated][runtime_api::validate].
//! Building upon the older blocks happens relatively rare so this does not affect blocks filling.
//!
//! The view is wrapper around [`Pool`] and exposes its functionality, including the ability
//! of [tracking][`Watcher`] the progress of every transaction.
//!
//! #### Views: active, inactive.
//! All the views are stored in [`ViewStore`] structure. In this documentation the views at the tips
//! of the forks are referred as [`active_views`], while the intermediate views as
//! [`inactive_views`].
//!
//!
//! #### The life cycle of the [`View`].
//! Views are created when the new [`ChainEvent`] is notified to the pool. The view that is
//! [closest][find_best_view] to the newly notified block is chosen to clone from. Once built and
//! updated the newly created view is placed in [`active_views`]. Detailed description of view
//! creation is described in [the material to follow](#handling-the-new-best-block). When the view
//! is no longer at the tip of the forks, it is moved to the [`inactive_views`]. When the block
//! number of the view is lower then the finalized block, the view is permanently removed.
//!
//!
//! *Example*:
//! The following chain:
//! ```text
//!    C2 - C3 - C4
//!   /
//! B1
//!   \
//!    B2 - B3 - B4
//! ```
//! and the following set of events:
//! ```text
//! New best block: B1, C3, C4, B4
//! ```
//! will result in the following set of views within the [`ViewStore`]:
//! ```text
//!   active: C4, B4
//! inactive: B1, C3
//! ```
//! Please note that views are only created for the notified blocks.
//!
//!
//! ### View store.
//! [`ViewStore`] is the helper structure that provides means to perform some actions like
//! [`submit`] or [`submit_and_watch`] on every view. It keeps track of both active and inactive
//! views.
//!
//! It also keeps tracks of the `most_recent_view` which is used to implement some methods of
//! [TransactionPool API], see [API considerations](#api-considerations) section.
//!
//! ### Multi-view listeners
//! There is a number of event streams that are provided by individual views:
//! - [transaction status][`Watcher`],
//! - [ready notification][`vp::import_notification_stream`] (see [networking
//!   section](#networking)),
//! - [dropped notification][`create_dropped_by_limits_stream`].
//!
//! These streams need to be merged into a single stream exposed by transaction pool (or used
//! internally). Those aggregators are often referred as multi-view listeners and they implement
//! stream-specific or event-specific logic.
//!
//! The most important is [`MultiViewListener`] which is owned by view store.
//! More information about it is provided in [transaction
//! route](#transaction-route-submit_and_watch) section.
//!
//!
//! ### Intermediate transactions buffer: [`TxMemPool`]
//! The main purpose of an internal [`TxMemPool`] (referred to as *mempool*) is to prevent a
//! transaction from being lost, e.g. due to race condition when the new transaction submission
//! occurs just before the new view is created. This could also happen when a transaction is invalid
//! on one fork and could be valid on another which is not yet fully processed by the maintain
//! procedure. Additionally, it allows the pool to accept transactions when no blocks have been
//! reported yet.
//!
//! Since watched and non-watched transactions require a different treatment, the *mempool* keeps a
//! track on how the transaction was submitted. The [transaction source][`TransactionSource`] used
//! to submit transactions also needs to be kept in the *mempool*. The *mempool* transaction is a
//! simple [wrapper][`TxInMemPool`] around the [`Arc`] reference to the actual extrinsic body.
//!
//! Once the view is created, all transactions from *mempool* are submitted to and validated at this
//! view.
//!
//! The *mempool* removes its transactions when they get finalized. The transactions in *mempool*
//! are also periodically verified at every finalized block and removed from the *mempool* if no
//! longer valid. This is process is called [*mempool* revalidation](#mempool-pruningrevalidation).
//!
//! ## Flows
//!
//! The transaction pool internally is executing numerous tasks. This includes handling submitted
//! transactions and tracking their progress, listening to [`ChainEvent`]s and executing the
//! maintain process, which aims to provide the set of ready transactions. On the other side
//! transaction pool provides a [`ready_at`] future that resolves to the iterator of ready
//! transactions. On top of that pool performs background revalidation jobs.
//!
//! This section provides a top level overview of all flows within the fork aware transaction pool.
//!
//! ### Transaction route: [`submit`][`api_submit`]
//! This flow is simple. Transaction is added to the mempool and if it is not rejected by it (due to
//! size limits), it is also [submitted][`submit`] into every view in [`active_views`].
//!
//! When the newly created view does not contain this transaction yet, it is
//! [re-submitted][ForkAwareTxPool::update_view_with_mempool] from [`TxMemPool`] into this view.
//!
//! ### Transaction route: [`submit_and_watch`][`api_submit_and_watch`]
//!
//! The [`submit_and_watch`] function allows to submit the transaction and track its
//! [status][`TransactionStatus`] within the pool. Every view is providing an independent
//! [stream][`View::submit_and_watch`] of events, which needs to be merged into the single stream
//! exposed to the [external listener][`TransactionStatusStreamFor`]. For majority of events simple
//! forwarding of events would not work (e.g. we could get multiple [`Ready`] events, or [`Ready`] /
//! [`Future`] mix). Some additional stateful logic is required to filter and process the views'
//! events. It is also easier to trigger some events (e.g. [`Finalized`], [`Invalid`], and
//! [`Broadcast`]) using some side-channel and simply ignoring these events from the view. All the
//! before mentioned functionality is provided by the [`MultiViewListener`].
//!
//! When watched transaction is submitted to the pool it is added the *mempool* with watched
//! flag. The external stream for the transaction is created in a [`MultiViewListener`]. Then
//! transaction is submitted to every active [`View`] (using
//! [`submit_and_watch`][`View::submit_and_watch`]) and the resulting
//! views' stream is connected to the [`MultiViewListener`].
//!
//! ### Maintain
//! The transaction pool exposes the [task][`notification_future`] that listens to the
//! finalized and best block streams and executes the [`maintain`] procedure.
//!
//! The [`maintain`] is the main procedure of the transaction pool. It handles incoming
//! [`ChainEvent`]s, as described in the following two sub-sections.
//!
//! #### Handling the new (best) block
//! If the new block actually needs to be handled, the following steps are
//! executed:
//! - [find][find_best_view] the best view and clone it to [create a new
//! view][crate::ForkAwareTxPool::build_new_view],
//! - [update the view][ForkAwareTxPool::update_view_with_mempool] with the transactions from the
//!   *mempool*
//! 	- all transactions from the *mempool* (with some obvious filtering applied) are submitted to
//!    the view,
//! 	- for all watched transactions from the *mempool* the watcher is registered in the new view,
//! 	and it is connected to the multi-view-listener,
//! - [update the view][ForkAwareTxPool::update_view_with_fork] with the transactions from the [tree
//!   route][`TreeRoute`] (which is computed from the recent best block to newly notified one by
//!   [enactment state][`EnactmentState`] helper):
//! 	- resubmit the transactions from the retracted blocks,
//! 	- prune extrinsic from the enacted blocks, and trigger [`InBlock`] events,
//! - insert the newly created and updated view into the view store.
//!
//!
//! #### Handling the finalized block
//! The following actions are taken on every finalized block:
//! - send [`Finalized`] events for every transactions on the finalized [tree route][`TreeRoute`],
//! - remove all the views (both active and inactive) that are lower then finalized block from the
//! view store,
//! - removal of finalized transaction from the *mempool*,
//! - trigger [*mempool* background revalidation](#mempool-pruningrevalidation).
//! - clean up of multi-view listeners which is required to avoid ever-growing structures,
//!
//! ### Light maintain
//! The [maintain](#maintain) procedure can sometimes be quite heavy, and it may not be accomplished
//! within the time window expected by the block builder. On top of that block builder may want to
//! build few blocks in the raw, not giving the pool enough time to accomplish possible ongoing
//! maintain process.
//!
//! To address this, there is a [light version][`ready_at_light`] of the maintain procedure. It
//! [finds the best view][find_best_view], clones it and prunes all the transactions that were
//! included in enacted part of [tree route][`TreeRoute`] from the base view to the block at which a
//! ready iterator was requested. No new [transaction validations][runtime_api::validate] are
//! required to accomplish it.
//!
//! ### Providing ready transactions: `ready_at`
//! The [`ready_at`] function returns a [future][`crate::PolledIterator`] that resolves to the
//! [ready transactions iterator][`ReadyTransactions`]. The block builder shall wait either for the
//! future to be resolved or for timeout to be hit. To avoid building empty blocks in case of
//! timeout, the waiting for timeout functionality was moved into the transaction pool, and new API
//! function was added: [`ready_at_with_timeout`]. This function also provides a fall back ready
//! iterator which is result of [light maintain](#light-maintain).
//!
//! New function internally waits either for [maintain](#maintain) process triggered for requested
//! block to be accomplished or for the timeout. If timeout hits then the result of [light
//! maintain](#light-maintain) is returned. Light maintain is always executed at the beginning of
//! [`ready_at_with_timeout`] to make sure that it is available w/ o additional delay.
//!
//! If the maintain process for the requested block was accomplished before the `ready_at` functions
//! are called both of them immediately provide the ready transactions iterator (which is simply
//! requested on the appropriate instance of the [`View`]).
//!
//! The little [`ReadyPoll`] helper contained within [`ForkAwareTxPool`] as ([`ready_poll`])
//! implements the futures management.
//!
//! ### Background tasks
//! The [maintain](#maintain) procedure shall be as quick as possible, so heavy revalidation job is
//! delegated to the background worker. These includes view and *mempool* revalidation which are
//! both handled by the [`RevalidationQueue`] which simply sends revalidation requests to the
//! background thread.
//!
//! ####  View revalidation
//! View revalidation is performed in the background thread. Revalidation is executed for every
//! view. All the transaction from the view are [revalidated][`view::revalidate`].
//!
//! The fork-aware pool utilizes two threads to execute maintain and revalidation process
//! exclusively, ensuring maintain performance without overlapping with revalidation.
//!
//! The view revalidation process is [triggered][`start_background_revalidation`] at the very end of
//! the [maintain][`maintain`] process, and [stopped][`finish_background_revalidations`] at the
//! very beginning of the next maintenance execution (upon the next [`ChainEvent`] reception). The
//! results from the revalidation are immediately applied once the revalidation is
//! [terminated][crate::fork_aware_txpool::view::View::finish_revalidation].
//! ```text
//!                time: ---------------------->
//!  maintenance thread: M----M------M--M-M---
//! revalidation thread: -RRRR-RR-----RR-R-RRR
//! ```
//!
//! ####  Mempool pruning/revalidation
//! Transactions within *mempool* are constantly revalidated in the background. The
//! [revalidation][`mp::revalidate`] is performed in [batches][`batch_size`], and transactions that
//! were validated as latest, are revalidated first in the next iteration. The revalidation is
//! triggered on every finalized block. If a transaction is found to be invalid, the [`Invalid`]
//! event is sent and transaction is removed from the *mempool*.
//!
//! NOTE: There is one exception: if transaction is referenced by any view as ready, then it is
//! removed from the *mempool*, but not removed from the view. The [`Invalid`] event is not sent.
//! This case is not likely to happen, however it may need some extra attention.
//!
//! ### Networking
//! The pool is exposing [`ImportNotificationStream`][`import_notification_stream`], the dedicated
//! channel over which all ready transactions are notified. Internally this channel needs to merge
//! all ready events from every view. This functionality is implemented by
//! [`MultiViewImportNotificationSink`].
//!
//! The networking module is utilizing this channel to receive info about new ready transactions
//! which later will be propagated over the network. On the other side, when a transaction is
//! received networking submits transaction to the pool using [`submit`][`api_submit`].
//!
//! ### Handling invalid transactions
//! Refer to *mempool* revalidation [section](#mempool-pruningrevalidation).
//!
//! ## Pool limits
//! Every [`View`] has the [limits][`Options`] for the number or size of transactions it can hold.
//! Obviously the number of transactions in every view is not distributed equally, so some views
//! might be fully filled while others not.
//!
//! On the other hand the size of internal *mempool* shall also be capped, but transactions that are
//! still referenced by views should not be removed.
//!
//! When the [`View`] is at its limits, it can either reject the transaction during
//! submission process, or it can accept the transaction and drop different transaction which is
//! already in the pool during the [`enforce_limits`][`vp::enforce_limits`] process.
//!
//! The [`StreamOfDropped`] stream aggregating [per-view][`create_dropped_by_limits_stream`] streams
//! allows to monitor the transactions that were dropped by all the views (or dropped by some views
//! while not referenced by the others), what means that transaction can also be
//! [removed][`dropped_monitor_task`] from the *mempool*.
