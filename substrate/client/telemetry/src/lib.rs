//! Telemetry utilities.
//!
//! Calling `init_telemetry` registers a global `slog` logger using `slog_scope::set_global_logger`.
//! After that, calling `slog_scope::with_logger` will return a logger that sends information to
//! the telemetry endpoints. The `telemetry!` macro is a short-cut for calling
//! `slog_scope::with_logger` followed with `slog_log!`.
//!
//! Note that you are supposed to only ever use `telemetry!` and not `slog_scope::with_logger` at
//! the moment. Substate may eventually be reworked to get proper `slog` support, including sending
//! information to the telemetry.
//!
//! The [`Telemetry`] struct implements `Stream` and must be polled regularly (or sent to a
//! background thread/task) in order for the telemetry to properly function. Dropping the object
//! will also deregister the global logger and replace it with a logger that discards messages.
//! The `Stream` generates [`TelemetryEvent`]s.
//!
//! > **Note**: Cloning the [`Telemetry`] and polling from multiple clones has an unspecified behaviour.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use futures::prelude::*;
//!
//! let telemetry = substrate_telemetry::init_telemetry(substrate_telemetry::TelemetryConfig {
//! 	endpoints: substrate_telemetry::TelemetryEndpoints::new(vec![
//! 		// The `0` is the maximum verbosity level of messages to send to this endpoint.
//! 		("wss://example.com".into(), 0)
//! 	]),
//! 	// Can be used to pass an external implementation of WebSockets.
//! 	wasm_external_transport: None,
//! });
//!
//! // The `telemetry` object implements `Stream` and must be processed.
//! std::thread::spawn(move || {
//! 	futures::executor::block_on(telemetry.for_each(|_| future::ready(())));
//! });
//!
//! // Sends a message on the telemetry.
//! substrate_telemetry::telemetry!(substrate_telemetry::SUBSTRATE_INFO; "test";
//! 	"foo" => "bar",
//! )
//! ```
