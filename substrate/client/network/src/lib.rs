//! Substrate-specific P2P networking.
//!
//! **Important**: This crate is unstable and the API and usage may change.
//!
//! # Node identities and addresses
//!
//! In a decentralized network, each node possesses a network private key and a network public key.
//! In Substrate, the keys are based on the ed25519 curve.
//!
//! From a node's public key, we can derive its *identity*. In Substrate and libp2p, a node's
//! identity is represented with the [`PeerId`] struct. All network communications between nodes on
//! the network use encryption derived from both sides's keys, which means that **identities cannot
//! be faked**.
//!
//! A node's identity uniquely identifies a machine on the network. If you start two or more
//! clients using the same network key, large interferences will happen.
//!
//! # Substrate's network protocol
//!
//! Substrate's networking protocol is based upon libp2p. It is at the moment not possible and not
//! planned to permit using something else than the libp2p network stack and the rust-libp2p
//! library. However the libp2p framework is very flexible and the rust-libp2p library could be
//! extended to support a wider range of protocols than what is offered by libp2p.
//!
//! ## Discovery mechanisms
//!
//! In order for our node to join a peer-to-peer network, it has to know a list of nodes that are
//! part of said network. This includes nodes identities and their address (how to reach them).
//! Building such a list is called the **discovery** mechanism. There are three mechanisms that
//! Substrate uses:
//!
//! - Bootstrap nodes. These are hard-coded node identities and addresses passed alongside with
//! the network configuration.
//! - mDNS. We perform a UDP broadcast on the local network. Nodes that listen may respond with
//! their identity. More info [here](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/discovery/mdns.md).
//! mDNS can be disabled in the network configuration.
//! - Kademlia random walk. Once connected, we perform random Kademlia `FIND_NODE` requests in
//! order for nodes to propagate to us their view of the network. More information about Kademlia
//! can be found [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia).
//!
//! ## Connection establishment
//!
//! When node Alice knows node Bob's identity and address, it can establish a connection with Bob.
//! All connections must always use encryption and multiplexing. While some node addresses (eg.
//! addresses using `/quic`) already imply which encryption and/or multiplexing to use, for others
//! the **multistream-select** protocol is used in order to negotiate an encryption layer and/or a
//! multiplexing layer.
//!
//! The connection establishment mechanism is called the **transport**.
//!
//! As of the writing of this documentation, the following base-layer protocols are supported by
//! Substrate:
//!
//! - TCP/IP for addresses of the form `/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/5`. Once the TCP connection is open, an
//! encryption and a multiplexing layer are negotiated on top.
//! - WebSockets for addresses of the form `/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/5/ws`. A TCP/IP connection is open and
//! the WebSockets protocol is negotiated on top. Communications then happen inside WebSockets data
//! frames. Encryption and multiplexing are additionally negotiated again inside this channel.
//! - DNS for addresses of the form `/dns4/example.com/tcp/5` or `/dns4/example.com/tcp/5/ws`. A
//! node's address can contain a domain name.
//!
//! On top of the base-layer protocol, the [Noise](https://noiseprotocol.org/) protocol is
//! negotiated and applied. The exact handshake protocol is experimental and is subject to change.
//!
//! The following multiplexing protocols are supported:
//!
//! - [Mplex](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/mplex). Support for mplex will likely
//! be deprecated in the future.
//! - [Yamux](https://github.com/hashicorp/yamux/blob/master/spec.md).
//!
//! ## Substreams
//!
//! Once a connection has been established and uses multiplexing, substreams can be opened. When
//! a substream is open, the **multistream-select** protocol is used to negotiate which protocol to
//! use on that given substream. In practice, Substrate opens the following substreams:
//!
//! - We periodically open an ephemeral substream in order to ping the remote and check whether the
//! connection is still alive. Failure for the remote to reply leads to a disconnection. This uses
//! the libp2p ping protocol.
//! - We periodically open an ephemeral substream in order to ask information from the remote. This
//! is called [the `identify` protocol](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/identify).
//! - We periodically open ephemeral substreams for Kademlia random walk queries. Each Kademlia
//! query is done in a new separate substream. This uses the
//! [standard libp2p Kademlia protocol](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/pull/108).
//! - We optionally keep a substream alive for all Substrate-based communications. The name of the
//! protocol negotiated is based on the *protocol ID* passed as part of the network configuration.
//! This protocol ID should be unique for each chain and prevents nodes from different chains from
//! connecting to each other. More information below.
//!
//! ## The Substrate substream
//!
//! Substrate uses a component named the **peerset manager (PSM)**. Through the discovery
//! mechanism, the PSM is aware of the nodes that are part of the network and decides which nodes
//! we should perform Substrate-based communications with. For these nodes, we open a connection
//! if necessary and open a unique substream for Substrate-based communications. If the PSM decides
//! that we should disconnect a node, then that substream is closed.
//!
//! For more information about the PSM, see the *sc-peerset* crate.
//!
//! Note that at the moment there is no mechanism in place to solve the issues that arise where the
//! two sides of a connection open the unique substream simultaneously. In order to not run into
//! issues, only the dialer of a connection is allowed to open the unique substream. When the
//! substream is closed, the entire connection is closed as well. This is a bug, and should be
//! fixed by improving the protocol.
//!
//! Within the unique Substrate substream, messages encoded using
//! [*parity-scale-codec*](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-scale-codec) are exchanged.
//! The detail of theses messages is not totally in place, but they can be found in the
//! `message.rs` file.
//!
//! Once the substream is open, the first step is an exchange of a *status* message from both
//! sides, containing information such as the chain root hash, head of chain, and so on.
//!
//! Communications within this substream include:
//!
//! - Syncing. Blocks are announced and requested from other nodes.
//! - Light-client requests. When a light client requires information, a random node we have a
//! substream open with is chosen, and the information is requested from it.
//! - Gossiping. Used for example by grandpa.
//!
//! It is intended that in the future each of these components gets more isolated, so that they
//! are free to open and close their own substreams, and so that syncing and light client requests
//! are able to communicate with nodes outside of the range of the PSM.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Using the `sc-network` crate is done through the [`NetworkWorker`] struct. Create this
//! struct by passing a [`config::Params`], then poll it as if it was a `Future`. You can extract an
//! `Arc<NetworkService>` from the `NetworkWorker`, which can be shared amongst multiple places
//! in order to give orders to the networking.
//!
//! See the [`config`] module for more information about how to configure the networking.
//!
//! After the `NetworkWorker` has been created, the important things to do are:
//!
//! - Calling `NetworkWorker::poll` in order to advance the network. This can be done by
//! dispatching a background task with the [`NetworkWorker`].
//! - Calling `on_block_import` whenever a block is added to the client.
//! - Calling `on_block_finalized` whenever a block is finalized.
//! - Calling `trigger_repropagate` when a transaction is added to the pool.
//!
//! More precise usage details are still being worked on and will likely change in the future.
