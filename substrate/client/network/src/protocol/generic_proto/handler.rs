//! Implementations of the `IntoProtocolsHandler` and `ProtocolsHandler` traits for both incoming
//! and outgoing substreams for all gossiping protocols together.
//!
//! This is the main implementation of `ProtocolsHandler` in this crate, that handles all the
//! protocols that are Substrate-related and outside of the scope of libp2p.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! From an API perspective, the [`NotifsHandler`] is always in one of the following state (see [`State`]):
//!
//! - Closed substreams. This is the initial state.
//! - Closed substreams, but remote desires them to be open.
//! - Open substreams.
//! - Open substreams, but remote desires them to be closed.
//!
//! The [`NotifsHandler`] can spontaneously switch between these states:
//!
//! - "Closed substreams" to "Closed substreams but open desired". When that happens, a
//! [`NotifsHandlerOut::OpenDesiredByRemote`] is emitted.
//! - "Closed substreams but open desired" to "Closed substreams" (i.e. the remote has cancelled
//! their request). When that happens, a [`NotifsHandlerOut::CloseDesired`] is emitted.
//! - "Open substreams" to "Open substreams but close desired". When that happens, a
//! [`NotifsHandlerOut::CloseDesired`] is emitted.
//!
//! The user can instruct the `NotifsHandler` to switch from "closed" to "open" or vice-versa by
//! sending either a [`NotifsHandlerIn::Open`] or a [`NotifsHandlerIn::Close`]. The `NotifsHandler`
//! must answer with [`NotifsHandlerOut::OpenResultOk`] or [`NotifsHandlerOut::OpenResultErr`], or
//! with [`NotifsHandlerOut::CloseResult`].
//!
//! When a [`NotifsHandlerOut::OpenResultOk`] is emitted, the `NotifsHandler` is now in the open
//! state. When a [`NotifsHandlerOut::OpenResultErr`] or [`NotifsHandlerOut::CloseResult`] is
//! emitted, the `NotifsHandler` is now (or remains) in the closed state.
//!
//! When a [`NotifsHandlerOut::OpenDesiredByRemote`] is emitted, the user should always send back either a
//! [`NotifsHandlerIn::Open`] or a [`NotifsHandlerIn::Close`].If this isn't done, the remote will
//! be left in a pending state.
//!
//! It is illegal to send a [`NotifsHandlerIn::Open`] before a previously-emitted
//! [`NotifsHandlerIn::Open`] has gotten an answer.
