/// Implements the `IntoProtocolsHandler` trait of libp2p.
///
/// Every time a connection with a remote starts, an instance of this struct is created and
/// sent to a background task dedicated to this connection. Once the connection is established,
/// it is turned into a `LegacyProtoHandler`. It then handles all communications that are specific
/// to Substrate on that single connection.
///
/// Note that there can be multiple instance of this struct simultaneously for same peer. However
/// if that happens, only one main instance can communicate with the outer layers of the code. In
/// other words, the outer layers of the code only ever see one handler.
///
/// ## State of the handler
///
/// There are six possible states for the handler:
///
/// - Enabled and open, which is a normal operation.
/// - Enabled and closed, in which case it will try to open substreams.
/// - Disabled and open, in which case it will try to close substreams.
/// - Disabled and closed, in which case the handler is idle. The connection will be
///   garbage-collected after a few seconds if nothing more happens.
/// - Initializing and open.
/// - Initializing and closed, which is the state the handler starts in.
///
/// The Init/Enabled/Disabled state is entirely controlled by the user by sending `Enable` or
/// `Disable` messages to the handler. The handler itself never transitions automatically between
/// these states. For example, if the handler reports a network misbehaviour, it will close the
/// substreams but it is the role of the user to send a `Disabled` event if it wants the connection
/// to close. Otherwise, the handler will try to reopen substreams.
/// The handler starts in the "Initializing" state and must be transitionned to Enabled or Disabled
/// as soon as possible.
///
/// The Open/Closed state is decided by the handler and is reported with the `CustomProtocolOpen`
/// and `CustomProtocolClosed` events. The `CustomMessage` event can only be generated if the
/// handler is open.
///
/// ## How it works
///
/// When the handler is created, it is initially in the `Init` state and waits for either a
/// `Disable` or an `Enable` message from the outer layer. At any time, the outer layer is free to
/// toggle the handler between the disabled and enabled states.
///
/// When the handler switches to "enabled", it opens a substream and negotiates the protocol named
/// `/substrate/xxx`, where `xxx` is chosen by the user and depends on the chain.
///
/// For backwards compatibility reasons, when we switch to "enabled" for the first time (while we
/// are still in "init" mode) and we are the connection listener, we don't open a substream.
///
/// In order the handle the situation where both the remote and us get enabled at the same time,
/// we tolerate multiple substreams open at the same time. Messages are transmitted on an arbitrary
/// substream. The endpoints don't try to agree on a single substream.
///
/// We consider that we are now "closed" if the remote closes all the existing substreams.
/// Re-opening it can then be performed by closing all active substream and re-opening one.
