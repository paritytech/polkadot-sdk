//! Statement handling to plug on top of the network service.
//!
//! This crate implements gossip-based propagation of statements between nodes, layered on the
//! substrate notifications protocol. Two protocol versions are negotiated per peer: `statement/2`
//! (preferred) with `statement/1` as a fallback.
//!
//! ## Propagation
//!
//! - During major chain synchronization, statement gossip is paused so peers prioritize downloading
//!   blocks; it resumes automatically once the node is fully synced (peers are reconnected to
//!   recover statements missed while syncing).
//! - A statement is never sent back to a peer it was received from (see Tracking received
//!   statements).
//! - A propagation loop runs every second (`config::PROPAGATE_TIMEOUT`): it takes all statements
//!   added since the previous round and queues their hashes to a per-peer outbox. Each peer has at
//!   most one propagation chunk in flight at a time. When its send slot is free, statements are
//!   fetched from the store, filtered and encoded up to the maximum notification size
//!   (`config::MAX_STATEMENT_NOTIFICATION_SIZE`, ~1 MiB).
//! - Incoming statements are pushed onto a bounded validation queue
//!   (`config::MAX_PENDING_STATEMENTS`); if the queue is full, incoming statements are dropped.
//! - Peer reputation is adjusted based on statement quality (good, duplicate, invalid, flooding).
//!
//! ## Tracking received statements
//!
//! There is no per-peer record of delivered statements. A statement is propagated once, on the
//! tick after its import: the propagation pass drains the store's recent set, so no later pass
//! can pick it up again. The only duplicates worth preventing are statements sent back to the
//! peers they came from.
//!
//! While a statement waits for validation, the peers it came from are recorded in
//! `pending_statements_peers`. On import they move to `recently_received_statements`, and a
//! peer that resends the statement before its tick is added there too. The propagation pass
//! skips the recorded peers and clears `recently_received_statements` when done.
//!
//! Initial sync sends a snapshot of the whole store with no per-peer filtering, so a peer can
//! occasionally receive a statement twice and may charge a small reputation penalty for the
//! duplicate. TODO: dedupe the initial-sync and propagation paths once sends flow through a
//! per-peer outbox (issue #12838).
//!
//! ## Topic affinity and light nodes
//!
//! The `statement/2` protocol lets a peer advertise which topics it cares about as a bloom filter
//! ("topic affinity"). Once a peer has an active affinity filter, only matching statements are
//! forwarded to it; when its affinity changes, newly relevant statements are re-sent. Affinity
//! advertisements are rate-limited. See the `affinity` module.
//!
//! Light-client peers on `statement/2` must advertise an affinity before receiving any statements:
//! a light V2 peer pulls only the topics it cares about instead of the full feed, and is synced
//! those statements in an initial burst on connect. Full nodes receive all statements unless they
//! opt into an affinity.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! - Use [`StatementHandlerPrototype::new`] to create a prototype.
//! - Pass the `NonDefaultSetConfig` returned from [`StatementHandlerPrototype::new`] to the network
//!   configuration as an extra peers set.
//! - Use [`StatementHandlerPrototype::build`] then [`StatementHandler::run`] to obtain a `Future`
//!   that processes statements.
