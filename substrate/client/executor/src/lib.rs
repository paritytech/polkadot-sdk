//! A crate that provides means of executing/dispatching calls into the runtime.
//!
//! There are a few responsibilities of this crate at the moment:
//!
//! - It provides an implementation of a common entrypoint for calling into the runtime, both
//! wasm and compiled.
//! - It defines the environment for the wasm execution, namely the host functions that are to be
//! provided into the wasm runtime module.
//! - It also provides the required infrastructure for executing the current wasm runtime (specified
//! by the current value of `:code` in the provided externalities), i.e. interfacing with
//! wasm engine used, instance cache.
