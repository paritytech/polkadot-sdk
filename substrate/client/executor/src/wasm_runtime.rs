	/// `host_functions` - The host functions that should be registered for the Wasm runtime.
	///
	/// # Return value
	///
	/// If no error occurred a tuple `(&mut WasmRuntime, H256)` is
	/// returned. `H256` is the hash of the runtime code.
	///
	/// In case of failure one of two errors can be returned:
	///
	/// `Err::InvalidCode` is returned for runtime code issues.

	/// `Error::InvalidMemoryReference` is returned if no memory export with the
