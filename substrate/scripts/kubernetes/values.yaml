validator:
  enable: True
  # adds --validator commandline option
  #
  # key and node-key can be given in a base64 encoded keyfile string (at 
  # validator.keys) which has the following format:
  #
  # substrate-0-key <key-seed>
  # substrate-0-node-key <node-secret-key>
  # substrate-1-key <key-seed>
  # substrate-1-node-key <node-secret-key>
  #
  # pod names are canonical. changing these or providing different amount of 
  # keys than the replicas count will lead to behaviour noone ever has 
  # experienced before.


# maybe adopt resource limits here to the nodes of the pool
# resources:
#   memory: "5Gi"
#   cpu: "1.5"
