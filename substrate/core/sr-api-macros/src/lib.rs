/// Tags given trait implementations as runtime apis.
///
/// All traits given to this macro, need to be declared with the `decl_runtime_apis!` macro.
/// The implementation of the trait should follow the declaration given to the `decl_runtime_apis!`
/// macro, besides the `Block` type that is required as first generic parameter for each runtime
/// api trait. When implementing a runtime api trait, it is required that the trait is referenced
/// by a path, e.g. `impl my_trait::MyTrait for Runtime`. The macro will use this path to access
/// the declaration of the trait for the runtime side.
///
/// The macro also generates the api implementations for the client side and provides it through
/// the `RuntimeApi` type. The `RuntimeApi` is hidden behind a `feature` called `std`.
///
/// To expose version information about all implemented api traits, the constant
/// `RUNTIME_API_VERSIONS` is generated. This constant should be used to instantiate the `apis`
/// field of `RuntimeVersion`.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// #[macro_use]
/// extern crate client;
/// extern crate sr_version as version;
///
/// use version::create_runtime_str;
/// # extern crate test_client;
/// # extern crate runtime_primitives;
/// # extern crate substrate_primitives;
/// #
/// # use runtime_primitives::traits::GetNodeBlockType;
/// # use test_client::runtime::{Block, Header};
/// #
/// # /// The declaration of the `Runtime` type and the implementation of the `GetNodeBlockType`
/// # /// trait are done by the `construct_runtime!` macro in a real runtime.
/// # pub struct Runtime {}
/// # impl GetNodeBlockType for Runtime {
/// #     type NodeBlock = Block;
/// # }
/// #
/// # decl_runtime_apis! {
/// #     /// Declare the api trait.
/// #     pub trait Balance {
/// #         /// Get the balance.
/// #         fn get_balance() -> u64;
/// #         /// Set the balance.
/// #         fn set_balance(val: u64);
/// #     }
/// #     pub trait BlockBuilder {
/// #        fn build_block() -> Block;

/// #           unimplemented!()

///         fn set_balance(_bal: u64) {
///             // Store the balance

/// Declares given traits as runtime apis.
///
/// The macro will create two declarations, one for using on the client side and one for using
/// on the runtime side. The declaration for the runtime side is hidden in its own module.
/// The client side declaration gets two extra parameters per function,
/// `&self` and `at: &BlockId<Block>`. The runtime side declaration will match the given trait
/// declaration. Besides one exception, the macro adds an extra generic parameter `Block: BlockT`
/// to the client side and the runtime side. This generic parameter is usable by the user.
///
/// For implementing these macros you should use the `impl_runtime_apis!` macro.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// #[macro_use]
/// extern crate client;
///
/// decl_runtime_apis! {
///     /// Declare the api trait.
///     pub trait Balance {
///         /// Get the balance.
///         fn get_balance() -> u64;
///         /// Set the balance.
///         fn set_balance(val: u64);
///     }
///
///     /// You can declare multiple api traits in one macro call.
///     /// In one module you can call the macro at maximum one time.
///     pub trait BlockBuilder {
///         /// The macro adds an explicit `Block: BlockT` generic parameter for you.
///         /// You can use this generic parameter as you would defined it manually.
///         fn build_block() -> Block;
///     }
/// }
///
/// # fn main() {}
/// ```
///
/// # Runtime api trait versioning
///
/// To support versioning of the traits, the macro supports the attribute `#[api_version(1)]`.
/// The attribute supports any `u32` as version. By default, each trait is at version `1`, if no
/// version is provided. We also support changing the signature of a method. This signature
/// change is highlighted with the `#[changed_in(2)]` attribute above a method. A method that is
/// tagged with this attribute is callable by the name `METHOD_before_version_VERSION`. This
/// method will only support calling into wasm, trying to call into native will fail (change the
/// spec version!). Such a method also does not need to be implemented in the runtime.
///
/// ```rust
/// #[macro_use]
/// extern crate client;
///
/// decl_runtime_apis! {
///     /// Declare the api trait.
///     #[api_version(2)]
///     pub trait Balance {
///         /// Get the balance.
///         fn get_balance() -> u64;
///         /// Set balance.
///         fn set_balance(val: u64);
///         /// Set balance, old version.
///         ///
///         /// Is callable by `set_balance_before_version_2`.
///         #[changed_in(2)]
///         fn set_balance(val: u16);
///         /// In version 2, we added this new function.
///         fn increase_balance(val: u64);
///     }
/// }
///
/// # fn main() {}
/// ```
///
/// To check if a given runtime implements a runtime api trait, the `RuntimeVersion` has the
/// function `has_api<A>()`. Also the `ApiExt` provides a function `has_api<A>(at: &BlockId)` to
/// check if the runtime at the given block id implements the requested runtime api trait.
