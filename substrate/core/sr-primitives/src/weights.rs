//! Primitives for transaction weighting.

//! Each dispatch function within `decl_module!` can have an optional `#[weight = $x]` attribute.
//! `$x` can be any type that implements the `ClassifyDispatch<T>` and `WeighData<T>` traits. By

//! Note that the decl_module macro _cannot_ enforce this and will simply fail if an invalid struct
