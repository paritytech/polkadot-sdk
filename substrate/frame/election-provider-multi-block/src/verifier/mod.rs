//! # The Verifier Pallet
//!
//! ### *Feasibility* Check
//!
//! Before explaining the pallet itself, it should be explained what a *verification* even means.
//! Verification of a solution page ([`crate::unsigned::miner::MinerConfig::Solution`]) includes the
//! process of checking all of its edges against a snapshot to be correct. For instance, all voters
//! that are presented in a solution page must have actually voted for the winner that they are
//! backing, based on the snapshot kept in the parent pallet.
//!
//! After checking all of the edges, a handful of other checks are performed:
//!
//! 1. Check that the total number of winners is sufficient (`DesiredTargets`).
//! 2. Check that the claimed score ([`sp_npos_elections::ElectionScore`]) is correct,
//!   3. and more than the minimum score that can be specified via [`Verifier::set_minimum_score`].
//! 4. Check that all of the bounds of the solution are respected, namely
//!    [`Verifier::MaxBackersPerWinner`], [`Verifier::MaxWinnersPerPage`] and
//!    [`Verifier::MaxBackersPerWinnerFinal`].
//!
//! Note that the common factor of all of these checks is that they can ONLY be checked after all
//! pages are already verified. So, In the case of a multi-page verification, these checks are
//! performed at the last page.
//!
//! The errors that can arise while performing the feasibility check are encapsulated in
//! [`verifier::FeasibilityError`].
//!
//! ## Modes of Verification
//!
//! The verifier pallet provide two modes of functionality:
//!
//! 1. Single-page, synchronous verification. This is useful in the context of single-page,
//!    emergency, or unsigned solutions that need to be verified on the fly. This is similar to how
//!    the old school `multi-phase` pallet works.
//! 2. Multi-page, asynchronous verification. This is useful in the context of multi-page, signed
//!    solutions.
//!
//! Both of this, plus some helper functions, is exposed via the [`Verifier`] trait.
//!
//! ## Queued Solution
//!
//! once a solution has been verified, it is called a *queued solution*. It is sitting in a queue,
//! waiting for either of:
//!
//! 1. being challenged and potentially replaced by better solution, if any.
//! 2. being exported as the final outcome of the election.
