//! # Verifier sub-pallet
//!
//! This pallet implements the NPoS solution verification logic. It supports both synchronous and
//! asynchronous verification of paged solutions. Moreover, it manages and ultimately stores
//! the best correct solution in a round, which can be requested by the election provider at the
//! time of the election.
//!
//! The paged solution data to be verified async is retrieved through the
//! [`Config::SolutionDataProvider`] implementor which most likely is the signed pallet.
//!
//! ## Feasibility check
//!
//! The goal of the feasibility of a solution is to ensure that a provided
//! [`crate::Config::Solution`] is correct based on the voter and target snapshots of a given round
//! kept by the parent pallet. The correctness of a solution is defined as:
//!
//! - The edges of a solution (voter -> targets) match the expected by the current snapshot. This
//! check can be performed at the page level.
//! - The total number of winners in the solution is sufficient. This check can only be performed
//!   when the full paged solution is available;;
//! - The election score is higher than the expected minimum score. This check can only be performed
//!   when the full paged solution is available;;
//! - All of the bounds of the election are respected, namely:
//!  * [`Verifier::MaxBackersPerWinner`] - which set the total max of voters are backing a target,
//!  per election. This check can only be performed when the full paged solution is available;
//!  * [`Verifier::MaxWinnersPerPage`] - which ensure that a paged solution has a bound on the
//!  number of targets. This check can be performed at the page level.
//!
//! Some checks can be performed at the page level (e.g. correct edges check) while others can only
//! be performed when the full solution is available.
//!
//! ## Sync and Async verification modes
//!
//! 1. Single-page, synchronous verification. This mode is used when a single page needs to be
//!    verified on the fly, e.g. unsigned submission.
//! 2. Multi-page, asynchronous verification. This mode is used in the context of the multi-paged
//!    signed solutions.
//!
//! The [`crate::verifier::Verifier`] and [`crate::verifier::AsyncVerifier`] traits define the
//! interface of each of the verification modes and this pallet implements both traits.
//!
//! ## Queued solution
//!
//! Once a solution has been succefully verified, it is stored in a queue. This pallet implements
//! the [`SolutionDataProvider`] trait which allows the parent pallet to request a correct
//! solution for the current round.
