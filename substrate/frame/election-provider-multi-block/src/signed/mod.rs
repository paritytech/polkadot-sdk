//! # Signed sub-pallet
//!
//! The main goal of the signed sub-pallet is to keep and manage a list of sorted score commitments
//! and correponding paged solutions during the [`crate::Phase::Signed`].
//!
//! Accounts may submit up to [`Config::MaxSubmissions`] score commitments per election round and
//! this pallet ensures that the scores are stored under the map `SortedScores` are sorted and keyed
//! by the correct round number.
//!
//! Each submitter must hold a deposit per submission that is calculated based on the number of
//! pages required for a full submission and the number of submissions in the queue. The deposit is
//! returned in case the claimed score is correct after the solution verification. Note that if a
//! commitment and corresponding solution are not verified during the verification phase, the
//! submitter is not slashed and the deposits returned.
//!
//! When the time to evaluate the signed submission comes, the solutions are checked from best to
//! worse, which may result in one of three scenarios:
//!
//! 1. If the committed score and page submissions are correct, the submitter is rewarded.
//! 2. Any queued score that was not evaluated, the hold deposit is returned.
//! 3. Any invalid solution results in a 100% slash of the hold submission deposit.
//!
//! Once the [`crate::Phase::SignedValidation`] phase starts, the async verifier is notified to
//! start verifying the best queued solution.
//!
//! TODO:
//! - Be more efficient with cleaning up the submission storage by e.g. expose an extrinsic that
//! allows anyone to clean up the submissions storage with a small reward from the submission
//! deposit (clean up storage submissions and all corresponding metadata).
