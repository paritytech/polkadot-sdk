//! # Signed sub-pallet
//!
//! The main goal of the signed sub-pallet is to manage a solution submissions from list of sorted
//! score commitments and correponding paged solutions during the [`crate::Phase::Signed`] and to
//! implement the [`SolutionDataProvider`] trait which exposes an interface for external entities to
//! fetch data related to signed submissions for the active round.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//!	The core logic of this pallet is only active during [`Phase::Signed`]. During the signed phase,
//!	accounts can register a solution for the current round and submit the solution's pages, one per
//!	extrindic call. The main flow is the following:
//!
//! 1. [`Phase::Signed`] is enacted in the parent EPM pallet;
//! 2. Submitters call [`Call::register`] to register a solution with a given claimed score. This
//!    pallet ensures that accepted submission registrations (encapsulated as
//!    [`SubmissionMetadata`]) are kept sorted by claimed score in the [`SubmissionMetadata`]
//!    storage map. This pallet accepts up to [`Config::MaxSubmissions`] active registrations per
//!    round.
//! 3. Submitters that have successfully registered, may submit the solution pages through
//!    [`Call::submit_page`], one page per call.
//! 4. Submitters may bail from a registered solution by calling [`Call::bail`]. Bailing from a
//!    solution registration will result in a partial slash.
//! 5. This pallet implements the trait [`SolutionDataProvider`] which exposes methods for external
//!    entities (e.g. verifier pallet) to query the data and metadata of the current best submitted
//!    solution.
//! 6. Upon solution verification (performed by an external entity e.g. the verifier pallet),
//!    [`SolutionDataProvider::report_result`] can be called to report the verification result of
//!    the current best solution. Depending on the result, the corresponding submitter's deposit may
//!    be fully slashed or the submitter may be rewarded with [`Config::Reward`].
//!
//! Accounts may submit up to [`Config::MaxSubmissions`] score commitments per election round and
//! this pallet ensures that the scores are stored under the map `SortedScores` are sorted and keyed
//! by the correct round number.
//!
//! ## Reporting the verification result
//!
//! When the time to evaluate the signed submission comes, the solutions are checked from best to
//! worse. The [`SolutionDataProvider`] trait exposes the submission data and metadata to an
//! external entity that verifies the queued solutions until it accepts one solution (or none). The
//! verifier entity reports the result of the solution verification which may result in one of three
//! scenarios:
//!
//! 1. If the *best* committed score and page submissions are correct, the submitter is rewarded.
//! 2. Any queued score that was not evaluated, the held deposit is fully returned.
//! 3. Any invalid solution results in a 100% slash of the held deposit.
//!
//! ## Submission deposit
//!
//! Each submitter must hold a "base deposit" per submission that is calculated based on the number
//! of the number of submissions in the queue. In addition, for each solution page submitted there
//! is a fixed [`Config::PageDeposit`] deposit held. The held deposit may be returned or slashed at
//! by the end of the round, depending on the following:
//!
//! 1. If a submission is verified and accepted, the deposit is returned.
//! 2. If a submission is verified and not accepted, the whole deposit is slashed.
//! 3. If a submission is not verified, the deposit is returned.
//! 4. Bailing a registration will return the page deposit and burn the base balance.
//!
//! The deposit is burned when all the data from the submitter is cleared through the
//! [`Call::force_clear_submission`].
//!
//! ## Submission reward
//!
//! Exposing [`SolutionDataProvider::report_result`] allows an external verifier to signal whether
//! the current best solution is correct or not. If the solution is correct, the submitter is
//! rewarded and the pallet can start clearing up the state of the current round.
//!
//! ## Storage management
//!
//! ### Storage mutations
//!
//! The [`Submissions`] wraps all the mutation and getters related to the sorted scores, metadata
//! and submissions storage types. All the mutations to those storage items *MUST* be performed
//! through [`Submissions`] to leverage the mutate checks and ensure the data consistency of the
//! submissions data.
//!
//! ### Clearing up the storage
//!
//! The [`SortedScores`] of the *active* submissions in a
//! given round. Each of the registered submissions may have one or more associated paged solution
//! stored in [`SubmissionsStorage`] and its corresponding [`SubmissionMetadata`].
//!
//! This pallet never implicitly clears either the metadata or the paged submissions storage data.
//! The data is kept in storage until [`Call::force_clear_submission`] extrinsic is called. At that
//! time, the hold deposit may be slashed depending on the state of the `release_strategy`
//! associated with the metadata.
