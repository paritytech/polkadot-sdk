//! # Stake Tracker Pallet
//!
//! The stake-tracker pallet is responsible to keep track of the voter's stake and target's approval
//! voting in the staking system.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The stake-tracker pallet listens to staking events through implementing the [`OnStakingUpdate`]
//! trait and, based on those events, ensures that the score of nodes in the lists
//! [`Config::VoterList`] and [`Config::TargetList`] are kept up to date with the staker's bonds
//! and nominations in the system. In addition, the pallet also ensures that [`Config::TargetList`]
//! is *strictly sorted* based on the targets' approvals.
//!
//! ## Goals
//!
//! The [`OnStakingUpdate`] implementation aims to achieve the following goals:
//!
//! * The [`Config::TargetList`] keeps a sorted list of validators, sorted by approvals
//! (which include self-vote and nominations' stake).
//! * The [`Config::VoterList`] keeps a semi-sorted list of voters, loosely sorted by bonded stake.
//! This pallet does nothing to ensure that the voter list sorting is correct.
//! * The [`Config::TargetList`] sorting must be *always* kept up to date, even in the event of new
//! nomination updates, nominator/validator slashes and rewards. This pallet *must* ensure that the
//! scores of the targets are always up to date *and* the targets are sorted by score at all time.
//!
//! Note that from the POV of this pallet, all events will result in one or multiple updates to
//! [`Config::VoterList`] and/or [`Config::TargetList`] state. If a set of staking updates require
//! too much weight to process (e.g. at nominator's rewards payout or at nominator's slashes), the
//! event emitter should handle that in some way (e.g. buffering events and implementing a
//! multi-block event emitter).
//!
//! ## Staker status and list invariants
//!
//! There are a few list invariants that depend on the staker's (nominator or validator) state, as
//! exposed by the [`Config::Staking`] interface:
//!
//! * A [`sp_staking::StakerStatus::Nominator`] is part of the voter list and its self-stake is the
//! voter list's score.
//! * A [`sp_staking::StakerStatus::Validator`] is part of both voter and target list. And its
//! approvals score (nominations + self-stake) is kept up to date as the target list's score.
//! * A [`sp_staking::StakerStatus::Idle`] may have a target list's score while other stakers
//!   nominate the idle validator.
//! * A staker which is not recognized by staking (i.e. not bonded) may still have an associated
//! target list score, in case there are other nominators nominating it. The list's node will
//! automatically be removed onced all the voters stop nominating the unbonded account.
//!
//! ## Domain-specific consideration on [`Config::VoterList`] and [`Config::TargetList`]
//!
//! In the context of Polkadot's staking system, both the voter and target lists will be implemented
//! by a bags-list pallet, which implements the
//! [`frame_election_provider_support::SortedListProvider`] trait.
//!
//! Note that the score provider of the target's bags-list is the list itself. This, coupled with
//! the fact that the target list sorting must be always up to date, makes this pallet resposible
//! for ensuring that the score of the targets in the `TargetList` is *always* kept up to date.
//!
//! ## Event emitter ordering and staking ledger state updates
//!
//! It is important to ensure that the events are emitted from staking (i.e. the calls into
//! [`OnStakingUpdate`]) *after* the staking ledger has been updated by the caller, since the new
//! state will be fetched and used to update the sorted lists accordingly.
