//! # Stake Tracker Pallet
//!
//! The stake-tracker pallet is responsible to keep track of the voter's stake and target's approval
//! voting in the staking system.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The stake-tracker pallet listens to staking events through implementing the [`OnStakingUpdate`]
//! trait. Based on the emitted events, the goal of this pallet is to maintain a **strictly**
//! sorted list of targets by approval voting. This pallet may also update a voter list, based on
//! the configurations.
//!
//! For the voter list, the [`crate::VoterUpdateMode`] defines the type of sortition of the list,
//! namely:
//!
//! - [`crate::VoterUpdateMode::Lazy`]: will skip the score update in the voter list.
//! - [`crate::VoterUpdateMode::Strict`]: will ensure that the score updates are kept sorted
//! for the corresponding list. In this case, the [`Config::VoterList`] is *strictly*
//! sorted* by [`SortedListProvider::Score`] (note: from the time the sorting mode is strict).
//!
//! Note that insertions and removals of voter nodes will be executed regardless of the sorting
//! mode.
//!
//! ## Goals
//!
//! Note: these goals are assuming the both target list and sorted lists have
//! [`crate::VoterUpdateMode::Strict`] set.
//!
//! The [`OnStakingUpdate`] implementation (in strict mode) aims to achieve the following goals:
//!
//! * The [`Config::TargetList`] keeps a sorted list of validators, *strictly* sorted by approvals
//! (which include self-vote and nominations' stake).
//! * The [`Config::VoterList`] keeps a list of voters, *stricly* sorted by bonded stake if it has
//! [`crate::VoterUpdateMode::Strict`] mode enabled, otherwise the list is kept lazily sorted.
//! * The [`Config::TargetList`] sorting must be *always* kept up to date, even in the event of new
//! nomination updates, nominator/validator slashes and rewards. This pallet *must* ensure that the
//! scores of the targets and voters are always up to date and thus, that the targets and voters in
//! the lists are sorted by score at all time.
//!
//! Note that from the POV of this pallet, staking actions may result in one or multiple updates to
//! [`Config::VoterList`] and/or [`Config::TargetList`] state. If a set of staking updates require
//! too much weight to execute (e.g. at nominator's rewards payout or at slashes), the event emitter
//! should handle that in some way (e.g. buffering events and implementing a multi-block event
//! emitter).
//!
//! ## Staker status and list invariants
//!
//! Note: these goals are assuming the both target list and sorted lists have
//! [`crate::VoterUpdateMode::Strict`] set.
//!
//! * A [`sp_staking::StakerStatus::Nominator`] is part of the voter list and its self-stake is the
//! voter list's score. In addition, if the `VoterList` is in strict mode, the voters' scores are up
//! to date with the current stake returned by [`T::Staking::stake`].
//! * A [`sp_staking::StakerStatus::Validator`] is part of both voter and target list. In addition,
//! if the `TargetList` is in strict mode, its
//! approvals score (nominations + self-stake) is kept up to date as the target list's score.
//! * A [`sp_staking::StakerStatus::Idle`] may have a target list's score while other stakers
//!   nominate the idle validator.
//! * A "dangling" target, which is not an active staker anymore (i.e. not bonded), may still have
//!   an associated target list score. This may happen when active nominators are still nominating
//!   the target after the validator unbonded. The target list's node and score will automatically
//!   be removed onced all the voters stop nominating the unbonded account (i.e. the target's score
//!   drops to 0).
//!
//! For further details on the target list invariante, refer to [`Self`::do_try_state_approvals`]
//! and [`Self::do_try_state_target_sorting`].
//!
//! ## Event emitter ordering and staking ledger state updates
//!
//! It is important to ensure that the events are emitted from staking (i.e. the calls into
//! [`OnStakingUpdate`]) *after* the staking ledger has been updated by the caller, since the new
//! state will be fetched and used to update the sorted lists accordingly.
