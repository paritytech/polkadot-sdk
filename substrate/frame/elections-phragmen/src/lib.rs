//! # Phragmen Election Module.
//!
//! An election module based on sequential phragmen.
//!
//! ### Term and Round
//!
//! The election happens in _rounds_: every `N` blocks, all previous members are retired and a new
//! set is elected (which may or may not have an intersection with the previous set). Each round
//! lasts for some number of blocks defined by `TermDuration` storage item. The words _term_ and
//! _round_ can be used interchangeably in this context.
//!
//! `TermDuration` might change during a round. This can shorten or extend the length of the round.
//! The next election round's block number is never stored but rather always checked on the fly.
//! Based on the current block number and `TermDuration`, the condition `BlockNumber % TermDuration
//! == 0` being satisfied will always trigger a new election round.
//!
//! ### Voting
//!
//! Voters can vote for any set of the candidates by providing a list of account ids. Invalid votes
//! (voting for non-candidates) are ignored during election. Yet, a voter _might_ vote for a future
//! candidate. Voters reserve a bond as they vote. Each vote defines a `value`. This amount is
//! locked from the account of the voter and indicates the weight of the vote. Voters can update
//! their votes at any time by calling `vote()` again. This keeps the bond untouched but can
//! optionally change the locked `value`. After a round, votes are kept and might still be valid for
//! further rounds. A voter is responsible for calling `remove_voter` once they are done to have
//! their bond back and remove the lock.
//!
//! Voters also report other voters as being defunct to earn their bond. A voter is defunct once all
//! of the candidates that they have voted for are neither a valid candidate anymore nor a member.
//! Upon reporting, if the target voter is actually defunct, the reporter will be rewarded by the
//! voting bond of the target. The target will lose their bond and get removed. If the target is not
//! defunct, the reporter is slashed and removed. To prevent being reported, voters should manually
//! submit a `remove_voter()` as soon as they are in the defunct state.
//!
//! ### Candidacy and Members
//!
//! Candidates also reserve a bond as they submit candidacy. A candidate cannot take their candidacy
//! back. A candidate can end up in one of the below situations:
//!   - **Winner**: A winner is kept as a _member_. They must still have a bond in reserve and they
//!     are automatically counted as a candidate for the next election.
//!   - **Runner-up**: Runners-up are the best candidates immediately after the winners. The number
//!     of runners_up to keep is configurable. Runners-up are used, in order that they are elected,
//!     as replacements when a candidate is kicked by `[remove_member]`, or when an active member
//!     renounces their candidacy. Runners are automatically counted as a candidate for the next
//!     election.
//!   - **Loser**: Any of the candidate who are not a winner are left as losers. A loser might be an
//!     _outgoing member or runner_, meaning that they are an active member who failed to keep their
//!     spot. An outgoing will always lose their bond.
//!
//! ##### Renouncing candidacy.
//!
//! All candidates, elected or not, can renounce their candidacy. A call to [`renounce_candidacy`]
//! will always cause the candidacy bond to be refunded.
//!
//! Note that with the members being the default candidates for the next round and votes persisting
//! in storage, the election system is entirely stable given no further input. This means that if
//! the system has a particular set of candidates `C` and voters `V` that lead to a set of members
//! `M` being elected, as long as `V` and `C` don't remove their candidacy and votes, `M` will keep
//! being re-elected at the end of each round.
//!
