//! # Proxy Module
//! A module allowing accounts to give permission to other accounts to dispatch types of calls from
//! their signed origin.
//!
//! The accounts to which permission is delegated may be requied to announce the action that they
//! wish to execute some duration prior to execution happens. In this case, the target account may
//! reject the announcement and in doing so, veto the execution.
//!
//! - [`proxy::Config`](./trait.Config.html)

//! ## Overview

//! ### Dispatchable Functions

	///
	/// Details: This migration was introduced between Substrate 2.0-RC6 and Substrate 2.0 releases.
	/// Before this migration, the `Proxies` storage item used a tuple of `AccountId` and
	/// `ProxyType` to represent the proxy definition. After #6770, we switched to use a struct
	/// `ProxyDefinition` which additionally included a `BlockNumber` delay value. This function,
	/// simply takes any existing proxies using the old tuple format, and migrates it to the new
	/// struct by setting the delay to zero.
