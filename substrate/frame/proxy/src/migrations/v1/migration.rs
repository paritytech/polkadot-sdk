//! Migration from v0 to v1: Convert proxy and announcement reserves to holds.
//!
//! This migration uses multi-block execution with proxy preservation:
//! - Multi-block: Handles accounts with weight-limited batching without timing out
//! - Proxy preservation: Migration failures preserve proxy relationships with zero deposits
//! - No permanent fund loss, all funds move to free balance
//! - Self-recovery: Users can restore deposits when they have sufficient balance
//!
//! ## Zero-Deposit Preservation Strategy
//!
//! When hold creation fails, we preserve proxy relationships to avoid breaking critical access:
//!
//! ### Scenario 1: Regular Account with Successful Migration
//! ```text
//! Before migration:
//! - Account A owns proxies [B, C, D] with 30 tokens reserved
//!
//! After successful migration:
//! - Proxy relationships A‚Üí[B,C,D] preserved
//! - 30 tokens moved from reserves to holds
//! - Full functionality maintained seamlessly
//! ```
//!
//! ### Scenario 2: Regular Account with Failed Migration
//! ```text
//! Before migration:
//! - Account A owns proxies [B, C, D] with 30 tokens reserved
//! - Hold creation fails (e.g., too many existing holds)
//!
//! After failed migration:
//! - Proxy relationships A‚Üí[B,C,D] PRESERVED ‚úÖ
//! - 30 tokens unreserved to free balance
//! - Deposit field set to 0 (marking failed migration)
//! - Proxies continue working normally
//!
//! Self-recovery:
//! - When A wants to add new proxy E:
//!   - System detects zero deposit with existing proxies
//!   - Requires deposit for all proxies (A,B,C,D,E)
//!   - A provides full deposit via hold system
//! - When A removes proxy B:
//!   - No refund (deposit already in free balance)
//!   - Proxy B removed normally
//! ```
//!
//! ### Scenario 3: Pure Proxy Account (Critical Case)
//! ```text
//! Before migration:
//! - Pure Proxy P (no private key) created by Spawner S
//! - S controls P via proxy relationship
//! - P has 20 tokens deposit + 50 additional tokens
//!
//! After failed migration:
//! - Proxy relationship S‚ÜíP PRESERVED ‚úÖ
//! - 20 tokens unreserved to P's free balance
//! - P now has 70 free tokens, deposit = 0
//! - S STILL controls P via proxy ‚úÖ
//! - Pure proxy remains fully accessible!
//!
//! Both for regular and pure proxy, to fully recover and fix deposit inconsistencies, we can use a
//! remove/re-add approach, using `utility.batch_all` to ensure atomicity.
//! Atomicity is especially important for a pure proxy, as it prevents it from being orphaned.
//!
//! Benefits:
//! - No governance intervention needed
//! - No funds become stranded
//! - Critical access maintained
//! - S can continue using P normally
//! ```
//! ### Implementation Details
//! 1. Always unreserves funds from the old currency system
//! 2. Attempts to create holds in the new system
//! 3. On hold failure: keeps proxy config intact, sets deposit to 0
//! 4. Zero deposit serves as a permanent marker for failed migration
//! 5. No additional storage needed - uses existing deposit field
