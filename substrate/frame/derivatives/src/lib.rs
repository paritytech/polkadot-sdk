//! The purpose of the `pallet-derivatives` is to cover the following derivative asset support
//! scenarios:
//! 1. The `pallet-derivatives` can serve as an API for creating and destroying derivatives.
//! 2. It can store a mapping between the foreign original ID (e.g., XCM `AssetId` or `(AssetId,
//!    AssetInstance)`) and the local derivative ID.
//!
//! The scenarios can be combined.
//!
//! ### Motivation
//!
//! The motivation differs depending on the scenario in question.
//!
//! #### The first scenario
//!
//! The `pallet-derivatives` can be helpful when another pallet, which hosts the derivative assets,
//! doesn't provide a good enough way to create new assets in the context of them being derivatives.
//!
//! For instance, the asset hosting pallet might have an asset class (NFT collection or fungible
//! currency) creation extrinsic, but among its parameters, there could be things like some admin
//! account, currency decimals, various permissions, etc. When creating a regular (i.e.,
//! non-derivative) asset class via such an extrinsic, these parameters allow one to conveniently
//! set all the needed data for the asset class.
//! However, when creating a derivative asset class, we usually can't allow an arbitrary user to
//! influence such parameters since they should be set per the original asset class owner's desires.
//! Thus, we can either require a privileged origin for derivative asset classes (such as Root or
//! some collective) or we could provide an alternative API where the sensitive parameters are
//! omitted (and set by the chain runtime automatically).
//!
//! The first approach dominates in the ecosystem at the moment since:
//! 1. It is simple
//! 2. There was no pallet to make such an alternative API without rewriting individual
//!    asset-hosting pallets
//! 3. Only fungible derivatives were ever made (with rare exceptions like an NFT derivative
//!    collection on Karura).
//!
//! The fungible derivatives are one of the reasons because they almost always have at least
//! decimals and symbol information that should be correct, so only a privileged origin is
//! acceptable to do the registration, since there is no way (at the time of writing) to communicate
//! asset data between chains directly (this will be fixed when Fellowship RFC 125 will be
//! implemented).
//!
//! Derivative NFT collections and their tokens, on the other hand, just need to point to the
//! originals. An NFT derivative is meant to participate in mechanisms unique to the given hosting
//! chain, such as NFT fractionalization, nesting, etc., where only its ID is needed to do said
//! interactions.
//!
//! In the future, there could be interactions where NFT data is needed. These interactions will be
//! able to leverage XCM Asset Metadata instructions from Fellowship RFC 125. However, even with the
//! IDs only, there are use cases (as mentioned above), and more could be discovered. Requiring a
//! privileged origin where no sensitive parameters are needed for registering derivative NFT
//! collections is raising an unreasonable barrier for NFT interoperability between chains. So,
//! providing an API for unprivileged derivative registration is a preferable choice in this case.
//!
//! Moreover, the future data communication via XCM can benefit both fungible and non-fungible
//! derivative collections registration.
//! 1. The `create_derivative` extrinsic of this pallet can be configured to initiate the
//!    registration process
//! by sending the `ReportMetadata` instruction to the reserve chain. It can be configured such that
//! this can be done by anyone.
//! 2. The reserve chain will decide whether to send the data or an error depending on its state.
//! 3. Our chain will handle the reserve chain's response and decide whether it is okay to register
//!    the given asset.
//!
//! #### The second scenario
//!
//! Saving the mapping between the original ID and the derivative ID is needed when their types
//! differ and the derivative ID value can't be deterministically deduced from the original ID.
//!
//! This situation can arise in the following cases:
//! * The original ID type is incompatible with a derivative ID type.
//! For example, let `pallet-nfts` instance host derivative NFT collections. We can't set the
//! `CollectionId` (the derivative ID type) to XCM `AssetId` (the original ID type)
//! because `pallet-nfts` requires `CollectionId` to be incrementable.
//! * It is desired to have a continuous ID space for all objects, both derivative and local.
//! For instance, one might want to reuse the existing pallet combinations (like `pallet-nfts`
//! instance + `pallet-nfts-fractionalization` instance) without adding new pallet instances between
//! the one hosting NFTs and many special logic pallets. In this case, the original ID type would be
//! `(AssetId, AssetInstance)`, and the derivative ID type can be anything.
