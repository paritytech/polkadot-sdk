/// Trait representing generic coretime market logic.
///
/// ## Assumptions about the market implementations
/// - There are two types of orders: *purchase* and *renewal*.
/// - Every successful order either creates a bid or is resolved immediately.
/// - Coretime regions are equivalent from the user's perspective.
///
/// ## Market lifecycle
/// 1. [`Market::start_sales`] — initializes the market (if required).
/// 2. [`Market::place_order`], [`Market::place_renewal_order`], and [`Market::adjust_bid`] — users
///    purchase or bid for coretime regions and renew existing ones.
/// 3. [`Market::tick`] — called from `on_initialize` hook to execute time-dependent logic.

	fn configure(configuration: Self::Configuration) -> Result<(), Self::Error>;

	/// Start the coretime sales.
	///
	/// ### Parameters
	/// - `block_number`: Current relay chain block number.

	/// Depending on the implementation, this either: places a bid, or immediately executes the

	/// ### Parameters
	/// - `block_number`: Current relay chain block number.
	/// - `who`: Account placing the order.
	/// - `price_limit`: Maximum price the buyer is willing to pay.

	///
	/// Depending on the implementation, this either: places a bid, or immediately executes the

	/// ### Parameters
	/// - `block_number`: Current relay chain block number.
	/// - `who`: Account placing the order.
	/// - `renewal`: Renewal identifier.

	///
	/// This call may fail if the market does not allow increasing, decreasing,
	/// or withdrawing bids.
	///
	/// ### Parameters
	/// - `block_number`: Current relay chain block number.
	/// - `id`: The identifier of the bid to adjust.
	/// - `who`: Account adjusting the bid.
	/// - `new_price`: The new bid price. If `None` is provided, the bid will be withdrawn.

	/// Execute time-based market logic.
	///
	/// This function is called from the `on_initialize` hook by `pallet-broker`.

	/// - `now`: Current relay chain block number.
	/// - `weight_meter`: Used for advanced weight accounting.
