error: use of deprecated constant `pallet::warnings::ConstantWeight_0::_w`:
               It is deprecated to use hard-coded constant as call weight.
               Please instead benchmark all calls or put the pallet into `dev` mode.

               For more info see:

   = note: `-D deprecated` implied by `-D warnings`
   = help: to override `-D warnings` add `#[allow(deprecated)]`
