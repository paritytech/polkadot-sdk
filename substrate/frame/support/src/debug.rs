//! Runtime debugging and logging utilities.
//!
//! This module contains macros and functions that will allow
//! you to print logs out of the runtime code.
//!
//! First and foremost be aware that adding regular logging code to
//! your runtime will have a negative effect on the performance
//! and size of the blob. Luckily there are some ways to mitigate
//! this that are described below.
//!
//! First component to utilize debug-printing and loggin is actually
//! located in `primitives` crate: `sp_core::RuntimeDebug`.
//! This custom-derive generates `core::fmt::Debug` implementation,
//! just like regular `derive(Debug)`, however it does not generate
//! any code when the code is compiled to WASM. This means that
//! you can safely sprinkle `RuntimeDebug` in your runtime codebase,
//! without affecting the size. This also allows you to print/log
//! both when the code is running natively or in WASM, but note
//! that WASM debug formatting of structs will be empty.
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//!	use frame_support::debug;
//!
//! #[derive(sp_core::RuntimeDebug)]
//!	struct MyStruct {
//!   a: u64,
//!	}
//!
//! // First initialize the logger.
//! //
//! // This is only required when you want the logs to be printed
//! // also during non-native run.
//! // Note that enabling the logger has performance impact on
//! // WASM runtime execution and should be used sparingly.
//!	debug::RuntimeLogger::init();
//!
//! let x = MyStruct { a: 5 };
//!	// will log an info line `"My struct: MyStruct{a:5}"` when running
//!	// natively, but will only print `"My struct: "` when running WASM.
//!	debug::info!("My struct: {:?}", x);
//!
//!	// same output here, although this will print to stdout
//!	// (and without log format)
//!	debug::print!("My struct: {:?}", x);
//! ```
//!
//! If you want to avoid extra overhead in WASM, but still be able
//! to print / log when the code is executed natively you can use
//! macros coming from `native` sub-module. This module enables
//! logs conditionally and strips out logs in WASM.
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//!	use frame_support::debug::native;
//!
//! #[derive(sp_core::RuntimeDebug)]
//!	struct MyStruct {
//!   a: u64,
//!	}
//!
//! // We don't initialize the logger, since
//! // we are not printing anything out in WASM.
//!	// debug::RuntimeLogger::init();
//!
//! let x = MyStruct { a: 5 };
//!
//!	// Displays an info log when running natively, nothing when WASM.
//!	native::info!("My struct: {:?}", x);
//!
//!	// same output to stdout, no overhead on WASM.
//!	native::print!("My struct: {:?}", x);
//! ```
