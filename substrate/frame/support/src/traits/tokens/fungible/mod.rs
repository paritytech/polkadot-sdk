//! The traits for dealing with a single fungible token class and any associated types.
//!
//! Also see the [`frame_tokens`] reference docs for more information about the place of
//! `fungible` traits in Substrate.
//!
//! # Avaliable Traits
//! - [`Inspect`]: Regular balance inspector functions.
//! - [`Unbalanced`]: Low-level balance mutating functions. Does not guarantee proper book-keeping
//!   and so should not be called into directly from application code. Other traits depend on this
//!   and provide default implementations based on it.
//! - [`UnbalancedHold`]: Low-level balance mutating functions for balances placed on hold. Does not
//!   guarantee proper book-keeping and so should not be called into directly from application code.
//!   Other traits depend on this and provide default implementations based on it.
//! - [`Mutate`]: Regular balance mutator functions. Pre-implemented using [`Unbalanced`], though
//!   the `done_*` functions should likely be reimplemented in case you want to do something
//!   following the operation such as emit events.
//! - [`InspectHold`]: Inspector functions for balances on hold.
//! - [`MutateHold`]: Mutator functions for balances on hold. Mostly pre-implemented using
//!   [`UnbalancedHold`].
//! - [`InspectFreeze`]: Inspector functions for frozen balance.
//! - [`MutateFreeze`]: Mutator functions for frozen balance.
//! - [`Balanced`]: One-sided mutator functions for regular balances, which return imbalance objects
//!   which guarantee eventual book-keeping. May be useful for some sophisticated operations where
//!   funds must be removed from an account before it is known precisely what should be done with
//!   them.
//!
//! ## Terminology
//!
//! - **Total Issuance**: The total number of units in existence in a system.
//!
//! - **Total Balance**: The sum of an account's free and held balances.
//!
//! - **Free Balance**: A portion of an account's total balance that is not held. Note this is
//!   distinct from the Spendable Balance, which represents how much Balance the user can actually
//!   transfer.
//!
//! - **Held Balance**: Held balance still belongs to the account holder, but is suspended. It can
//!   be slashed, but only after all the free balance has been slashed.
//!
//!   Multiple holds stack rather than overlay. This means that if an account has
//!   3 holds for 100 units, the account can spend its funds for any reason down to 300 units, at
//!   which point the holds will start to come into play.
//!
//! - **Frozen Balance**: A freeze on a specified amount of an account's free balance until a
//!   specified block number.
//!
//!   Multiple freezes always operate over the same funds, so they "overlay" rather than
//!   "stack". This means that if an account has 3 freezes for 100 units, the account can spend its
//!   funds for any reason down to 100 units, at which point the freezes will start to come into
//!   play.
//!
//! - **Minimum Balance (a.k.a. Existential Deposit, a.k.a. ED)**: The minimum balance required to
//!   create or keep an account open. This is to prevent "dust accounts" from filling storage. When
//!   the free plus the held balance (i.e. the total balance) falls below this, then the account is
//!   said to be dead. It loses its functionality as well as any prior history and all information
//!   on it is removed from the chain's state. No account should ever have a total balance that is
//!   strictly between 0 and the existential deposit (exclusive). If this ever happens, it indicates
//!   either a bug in the implementation of this trait or an erroneous raw mutation of storage.
//!
//! - **Untouchable Balance**: The part of a user's free balance they cannot spend, due to ED or
//!   Freeze(s).
//!
//! - **Spendable Balance**: The part of a user's free balance they can actually transfer, after
//!   accounting for Holds and Freezes.
//!
//! - **Imbalance**: A condition when some funds were credited or debited without equal and opposite
//!   accounting (i.e. a difference between total issuance and account balances). Functions that
//!   result in an imbalance will return an object of the [`imbalance::Credit`] or
//!   [`imbalance::Debt`] traits that can be managed within your runtime logic.
//!
//!   If an imbalance is simply dropped, it should automatically maintain any book-keeping such as
//!   total issuance.
//!
//! ## Visualising Balance Components Together ðŸ’«
//!
//! ```ignore
//! |__total__________________________________|
//! |__on_hold__|_____________free____________|
//! |__________frozen___________|
//! |__on_hold__|__ed__|
//!             |__untouchable__|__spendable__|
//! ```
//!
//! ## Holds and Freezes
//!
//! Both holds and freezes are used to prevent an account from using some of its balance.
//!
//! The primary distinction between the two are that:
//! - Holds are cumulative (do not overlap) and are distinct from the free balance
//! - Freezes are not cumulative, and can overlap with each other or with holds
//!
//! ```ignore
//! |__total_____________________________|
//! |__hold_a__|__hold_b__|_____free_____|
//! |__on_hold____________|     // <- the sum of all holds
//! |__freeze_a_______________|
//! |__freeze_b____|
//! |__freeze_c________|
//! |__frozen_________________| // <- the max of all freezes
//! ```
//!
//! Holds are designed to be infallibly slashed, meaning that any logic using a `Freeze`
//! must handle the possibility of the frozen amount being reduced, potentially to zero. A
//! permissionless function should be provided in order to allow bookkeeping to be updated in this
//! instance. E.g. some balance is frozen when it is used for voting, one could use held balance for
//! voting, but nothing prevents this frozen balance from being reduced if the overlapping hold is
//! slashed.
//!
//! Every Hold and Freeze is accompanied by a unique `Reason`, making it clear for each instance
//! what the originating pallet and purpose is. These reasons are amalgomated into a single enum
//! `RuntimeHoldReason` and `RuntimeFreezeReason` respectively, when the runtime is compiled.
//!
//! Note that `Hold` and `Freeze` reasons should remain in your runtime for as long as storage
//! could exist in your runtime with those reasons, otherwise your runtime state could become
//! undecodable.
//!
//! ### Should I use a Hold or Freeze?
//!
//! If you require a balance to be infaillibly slashed, then you should use Holds.
//!
//! If you require setting a minimum account balance amount, then you should use a Freezes. Note
//! Freezes do not carry the same guarantees as Holds. Although the account cannot voluntarily
//! reduce their balance below the largest freeze, if Holds on the account are slashed then the
//! balance could drop below the freeze amount.
//!
//! ## Sets of Tokens
//!
//! For managing sets of tokens, see the [`fungibles`](`frame_support::traits::fungibles`) trait
//! which is a wrapper around this trait but supporting multiple asset instances.
//!
//! [`frame_tokens`]: ../../../../polkadot_sdk_docs/reference_docs/frame_tokens/index.html
