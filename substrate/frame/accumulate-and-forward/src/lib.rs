//! # Accumulate-and-Forward Pallet
//!
//! Intercepts configurable token inflows (transaction fees, dust removal, coretime revenue) on
//! system parachains and gathers them in a local accumulation account for periodic forwarding
//! to a configurable destination.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! - **Fees**: Use [`DealWithFeesSplit`] to split fees between accumulation and other handlers
//! - **Burns/Revenue**: Use the pallet as `OnUnbalanced<CreditOf>` handler (e.g., dust removal,
//!   coretime revenue)
//! Note: Direct calls to `pallet_balances::Pallet::burn()` extrinsic are not redirected to
//! the accumulation account — they still reduce total issuance directly.
//!
//! ## Setup
//!
//! The accumulation account must be pre-funded with at least the existential deposit.
//! For new chains, include the account in the balances genesis config.
//! For existing chains, fund it via a manual transfer.
//!
//! If the accumulation account is not pre-funded, deposits below ED will be silently burned.
//!
//! ## Total Issuance
//!
//! Accumulated funds are burnt upon forwarding (reducing `total_issuance` here) and the same
//! funds are minted at the destination when the sent message is received.
