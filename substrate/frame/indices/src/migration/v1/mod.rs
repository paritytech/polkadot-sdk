//! Migration from v0 to v1: Convert index reserves to holds.
//!
//! This migration uses multi-block execution with index preservation:
//! - Multi-block: Handles accounts with weight-limited batching without timing out
//! - Index preservation: Migration failures preserve index relationships with zero deposits
//! - No permanent fund loss, all funds move to free balance
//!
//! ## Zero-Deposit Preservation Strategy
//!
//! When hold creation fails, we preserve index relationships to avoid breaking users' access:
//!
//! ### Scenario 1: Regular Account with Successful Migration
//! ```text
//! Before migration:
//! - Account A owns index 123 with 30 tokens reserved
//!
//! After successful migration:
//! - Index relationship A→123 preserved
//! - 30 tokens moved from reserves to holds
//! - Full functionality maintained seamlessly
//! ```
//!
//! ### Scenario 2: Regular Account with Failed Migration
//! ```text
//! Before migration:
//! - Account A owns index 123 with 30 tokens reserved
//! - Hold creation fails
//!
//! After failed migration:
//! - Index relationship A→123 preserved
//! - 30 tokens unreserved to free balance
//! - Deposit field set to 0 (marking failed migration)
//! - Index continues working normally
//!
//! Self-recovery:
//! - When A wants to use the index:
//!   - System detects zero deposit with existing index
//!   - Requires deposit for the index
//!   - A provides full deposit via hold system
//! ```
//!
//! ### Scenario 3: Frozen Index Account
//! ```text
//! Before migration:
//! - Account A owns frozen index 456 with no tokens reserved (they got slashed to have the account frozen)
//! - Index is permanently assigned to A
//!
//! After migration:
//! - Index relationship A→456 preserved
//! - Frozen status maintained
//! - Index remains fully accessible!
//! ```
//! ### Implementation Details
//! 1. Always unreserves funds from the old currency system
//! 2. Attempts to create holds in the new system
//! 3. On hold failure: keeps index config intact, sets deposit to 0
//! 4. Zero deposit serves as a permanent marker for failed migration
//! 5. No additional storage needed - uses existing deposit field
