//! # Parachain-registrar shared primitives
//!
//! Types shared by the parachain registrar pallet (`pallet-registrar-para`) and relay-chain
//! registrar pallet (`pallet-registrar-relay`). This crate is deliberately free of any FRAME,
//! XCM, or network-specific dependency, so a single version of the wire types serves Westend,
//! Kusama and Polkadot, and so both pallets can depend on it without forming a dependency cycle.
//!
//! For the same reason the types here are plain: a para id is a `u32` (byte-compatible with the
//! relay chain's `Id` newtype), head data and validation code are `Vec<u8>`, and a validation
//! code hash is an [`H256`] (what `ValidationCodeHash` wraps). The same holds for
//! [`ParachainRegistrar`], the interface the relay pallet drives the registry through: conversion
//! to the relay chain's own types happens in the pallet implementing it.
