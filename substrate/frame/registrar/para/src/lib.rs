//! # Parachain registrar pallet
//!
//! The user-facing half of parachain registration. It hands out para ids, takes the manager's
//! deposits as [`Consideration`] tickets, and coordinates the registration itself asynchronously
//! with the chain that owns the parachain registry.
//!
//! Both directions of that coordination are abstract: requests go out through [`SendToRelay`],
//! verdicts come back in through [`Pallet::receive`], gated by [`Config::RelayOrigin`]. Nothing
//! here depends on XCM or on the other chain's extrinsics.
//!
//! ## Registration flow
//!
//! Registration takes two transactions on two chains. Sending a multi-megabyte validation code
//! through the messaging layer would be wasteful, so this chain only commits to its hash and
//! length and the blob is uploaded to the relay chain directly:
//!
//! 1. [`Pallet::reserve`] allocates a para id here and takes [`Config::ReservationConsideration`].
//! 2. [`Pallet::register`] takes [`Config::RegistrationConsideration`] for the head data and the
//!    *declared* code length, then asks the relay chain to accept the registration. Only the code
//!    hash and length are sent.
//! 3. The manager uploads the validation code to the relay chain, which accepts it only if it
//!    matches the hash and length committed to in step 2.
//! 4. The verdict arrives back as [`Pallet::receive`], which either finalises the registration or
//!    releases the registration deposit.
//!
//! ## Giving up
//!
//! Nothing on the relay chain times a registration out, so a request whose code never turns up
//! waits until the manager ends it with [`Pallet::cancel_registration`]. That asks the relay chain
//! to drop the authorization and only releases the deposit once it confirms, which is what
//! keeps a cancellation from freeing the deposit on a para that did register after all.
//!
//! ## Deregistering
//!
//! [`Pallet::deregister`] drops a merely reserved id on the spot, deposit returned. A registered
//! para is deregistered on the relay chain too: only its confirmation releases the deposits, a
//! refusal puts the entry back to registered. A verdict that never arrives is chased up with
//! [`Pallet::cancel_deregistration`], the counterpart of [`Pallet::cancel_registration`].
//!
//! Deposits only ever live on this chain; the relay chain takes nothing.
