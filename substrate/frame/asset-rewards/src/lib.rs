//! # FRAME Staking Rewards Pallet
//!
//! Allows accounts to be rewarded for holding `fungible` asset/s, for example LP tokens.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Initiate an incentive program for a fungible asset by creating a new pool.
//!
//! During pool creation, a 'staking asset', 'reward asset', 'reward rate per block', 'expiry
//! block', and 'admin' are specified.
//!
//! Once created, holders of the 'staking asset' can 'stake' them in a corresponding pool, which
//! creates a Freeze on the asset.
//!
//! Once staked, rewards denominated in 'reward asset' begin accumulating to the staker,
//! proportional to their share of the total staked tokens in the pool.
//!
//! Reward assets pending distribution are held in an account unique to each pool.
//!
//! Care should be taken by the pool operator to keep pool accounts adequately funded with the
//! reward asset.
//!
//! The pool admin may increase reward rate per block, increase expiry block, and change admin.
//!
//! ## Disambiguation
//!
//! While this pallet shares some terminology with the `staking-pool` and similar native staking
//! related pallets, it is distinct and is entirely unrelated to native staking.
//!
//! ## Permissioning
//!
//! Currently, pool creation and management restricted to a configured Origin.
//!
//! Future iterations of this pallet may allow permissionless creation and management of pools.
//!
//! Note: The permissioned origin must return an AccountId. This can be achieved for any Origin by
//! wrapping it with `EnsureSuccess`.
//!
//! ## Implementation Notes
//!
//! Internal logic functions such as `update_pool_and_staker_rewards` were deliberately written
//! without side-effects.
//!
//! Storage interaction such as reads and writes are instead all performed in the top level
//! pallet Call method, which while slightly more verbose, makes it easier to understand the
//! code and reason about how storage reads and writes occur in the pallet.
//!
//! ## Rewards Algorithm
//!
//! The rewards algorithm is based on the Synthetix [StakingRewards.sol](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/develop/contracts/StakingRewards.sol)
//! smart contract.
//!
//! Rewards are calculated JIT (just-in-time), and all operations are O(1) making the approach
//! scalable to many pools and stakers.
//!
//! ### Resources
//!
//! - [This video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZO5aYg1GI8), which walks through the math
//!   of the algorithm.
//! - [This dev.to article](https://dev.to/heymarkkop/understanding-sushiswaps-masterchef-staking-rewards-1m6f),
//!   which explains the algorithm of the SushiSwap MasterChef staking. While not identical to the
//!   Synthetix approach, they are quite similar.
