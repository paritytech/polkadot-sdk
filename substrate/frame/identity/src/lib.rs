//! # Identity Pallet
//!
//! - [`Config`]
//! - [`Call`]
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! A federated naming system, allowing for multiple registrars to be added from a specified origin.
//! Registrars can set a fee to provide identity-verification service. Anyone can put forth a
//! proposed identity for a fixed deposit and ask for review by any number of registrars (paying
//! each of their fees). Registrar judgements are given as an `enum`, allowing for sophisticated,
//! multi-tier opinions.
//!
//! Some judgements are identified as *sticky*, which means they cannot be removed except by
//! complete removal of the identity, or by the registrar. Judgements are allowed to represent a
//! portion of funds that have been reserved for the registrar.
//!
//! A super-user can remove accounts and in doing so, slash the deposit.
//!
//! All accounts may also have a limited number of sub-accounts which may be specified by the owner;
//! by definition, these have equivalent ownership and each has an individual name.
//!
//! The number of registrars should be limited, and the deposit made sufficiently large, to ensure
//! no state-bloat attack is viable.
//!
//! ### Usernames
//!
//! The pallet provides functionality for username authorities to issue usernames. When an account
//! receives a username, they get a default instance of `IdentityInfo`. Usernames also serve as a
//! reverse lookup from username to account.
//!
//! Username authorities are given an allocation by governance to prevent state bloat. Usernames
//! impose no cost or deposit on the user.
//!
//! Users can have multiple usernames that map to the same `AccountId`, however one `AccountId` can
//! only map to a single username, known as the _primary_.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! #### For General Users
//! * `set_identity` - Set the associated identity of an account; a small deposit is reserved if not
//!   already taken.
//! * `clear_identity` - Remove an account's associated identity; the deposit is returned.
//! * `request_judgement` - Request a judgement from a registrar, paying a fee.
//! * `cancel_request` - Cancel the previous request for a judgement.
//! * `accept_username` - Accept a username issued by a username authority.
//! * `remove_expired_approval` - Remove a username that was issued but never accepted.
//! * `set_primary_username` - Set a given username as an account's primary.
//! * `remove_dangling_username` - Remove a username that maps to an account without an identity.
//!
//! #### For General Users with Sub-Identities
//! * `set_subs` - Set the sub-accounts of an identity.
//! * `add_sub` - Add a sub-identity to an identity.
//! * `remove_sub` - Remove a sub-identity of an identity.
//! * `rename_sub` - Rename a sub-identity of an identity.
//! * `quit_sub` - Remove a sub-identity of an identity (called by the sub-identity).
//!
//! #### For Registrars
//! * `set_fee` - Set the fee required to be paid for a judgement to be given by the registrar.
//! * `set_fields` - Set the fields that a registrar cares about in their judgements.
//! * `provide_judgement` - Provide a judgement to an identity.
//!
//! #### For Username Authorities
//! * `set_username_for` - Set a username for a given account. The account must approve it.
//!
//! #### For Superusers
//! * `add_registrar` - Add a new registrar to the system.
//! * `kill_identity` - Forcibly remove the associated identity; the deposit is lost.
//! * `add_username_authority` - Add an account with the ability to issue usernames.
//! * `remove_username_authority` - Remove an account with the ability to issue usernames.
