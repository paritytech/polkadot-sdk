//! ## Warning: Experimental
//!
//! This crate and all of its content is experimental, and should not yet be used in production.
//!
//! ## Underlying dependencies
//!
//! This crate is an amalgamation of multiple other crates that are often used together to compose a
//! pallet. It is not necessary to use it, and it may fall short for certain purposes.
//!
//! In short, this crate only re-exports types and traits from multiple sources. All of these
//! sources are listed (and re-exported again) in [`deps`].
