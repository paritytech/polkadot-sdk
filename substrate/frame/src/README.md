</div>

`polkadot-sdk-frame` is an umbrella crate for the
[FRAME](https://docs.polkadot.com/polkadot-protocol/glossary/#frame-framework-for-runtime-aggregation-of-modularized-entities)
framework. It simplifies building FRAME pallets and runtimes by re-exporting all the necessary components for pallet development.

Outside the Polkadot SDK, `polkadot-sdk-frame` should be imported through the main Polkadot SDK [`umbrella crate`](../../../umbrella/src/lib.rs).

## ðŸ’» Usage

The main intended use of this crate is through **Preludes**, which re-export most of the components needed for pallet
development. The available preludes are:

- `prelude`: main prelude for pallet development, containing essential types and traits
- `testing_prelude`: testing utilities and helpers for writing pallet tests
- `runtime::prelude`: runtime-specific components for building blockchain runtimes
- `benchmarking::prelude`: benchmarking components for performance testing
- `weights_prelude`: components for the auto-generated `weight.rs` files

If you need specific dependencies that aren't included in the preludes, you can use the `deps` module to access all
FRAME and Substrate dependencies directly. However, we strongly recommend checking the preludes and domain-specific
modules first, as they provide a more organized and maintainable way to access these dependencies.
