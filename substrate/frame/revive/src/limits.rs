//! Limits that are observeable by contract code.

//! It is important to never change this limits without supporting the old limits
//! for already deployed contracts. This is what the [`crate::Contract::behaviour_version`]
//! is meant for. This is true for either increasing or decreasing the limit.
//!
//! Limits in this file are different from the limits configured on the [`Config`] trait which are
//! generally only affect actions that cannot be performed by a contract: For example things related
//! to deposits and weights are allowed to be changed as they are paid by root callers which
//! are not contracts.
//!
//! Exceptions to this rule apply: Limits in the [`code`] module can be increased
//! without emulating the old values for existing contracts. Reason is that those limits are only
//! applied **once** at code upload time. Since this action cannot be performed by contracts we
//! can change those limits without breaking existing contracts. Please keep in mind that we should
//! only ever **increase** those values but never decrease.
