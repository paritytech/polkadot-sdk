//! Functions to procedurally construct contract code used for benchmarking.
//!
//! In order to be able to benchmark events that are triggered by contract execution
//! (API calls into seal, individual instructions), we need to generate contracts that
//! perform those events. Because those contracts can get very big we cannot simply define
//! them as text (.wat) as this will be too slow and consume too much memory. Therefore
//! we define this simple definition of a contract that can be passed to `create_code` that
//! compiles it down into a `WasmModule` that can be used as a contract's code.
