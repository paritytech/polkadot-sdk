//! # Multi Asset Bounties Pallet ( `pallet-multi-asset-bounties` )
//!
//! ## Bounty
//!
//! A bounty is a reward for completing a specified body of work or achieving a defined set of
//! objectives. The work must be completed for a predefined amount to be paid out. A curator is
//! assigned when the bounty is funded, and is responsible for awarding the bounty once the
//! objectives are met. To support parallel execution and better governance, a bounty can be split
//! into multiple child bounties. Each child bounty represents a smaller task derived from the
//! parent bounty. The parent bounty curator may assign a separate curator to each child bounty at
//! creation time. The curator may be unassigned, resulting in a new curator election. A bounty may
//! be cancelled at any time—unless a payment has already been attempted and is awaiting status
//! confirmation.
//!
//! > NOTE: A parent bounty cannot be closed if it has any active child bounties associated with it.
//!
//! ### Terminology
//!
//! - **Bounty:** A reward for a predefined body of work upon completion. A bounty defines the total
//!   reward and can be subdivided into multiple child bounties. When referenced in the context of
//!   child bounties, it is referred to as *parent bounty*.
//! - **Curator:** An account managing the bounty and assigning a payout address.
//! - **Child Bounty:** A subtask or milestone funded by a parent bounty. It may carry its own
//!   curator, and reward similar to the parent bounty.
//! - **Curator deposit:** The payment in native asset from a candidate willing to curate a funded
//!   bounty. The deposit is returned when/if the bounty is completed.
//! - **Bounty value:** The total amount in a given asset kind that should be paid to the
//!   Beneficiary if the bounty is rewarded.
//! - **Beneficiary:** The account/location to which the total or part of the bounty is assigned to.
//!
//! ### Example
//!
//! 1. Fund a bounty approved by spend origin of some asset kind with a proposed curator.
#![doc = docify::embed!("src/tests.rs", fund_bounty_works)]
//!
//! 2. Award a bounty to a beneficiary.
#![doc = docify::embed!("src/tests.rs", award_bounty_works)]
//!
//! ## Pallet API
//!
//! See the [`pallet`] module for more information about the interfaces this pallet exposes,
//! including its configuration trait, dispatchables, storage items, events and errors.
