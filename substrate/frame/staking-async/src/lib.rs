//! # Staking Async Pallet
//!
//! This pallet is a fork of the original `pallet-staking`, with a number of key differences:
//!
//! * It no longer has access to a secure timestamp, previously used to calculate the duration of an
//!   era.
//! * It no longer has access to a pallet-session.
//! * It no longer has access to a pallet-authorship.
//! * It is capable of working with a multi-page `ElectionProvider``, aka.
//!   `pallet-election-provider-multi-block`.
//!
//! While `pallet-staking` was somewhat general-purpose, this pallet is absolutely NOT right from
//! the get-go: It is designed to be used ONLY in Polkadot/Kusama AssetHub system parachains.
//!
//! The workings of this pallet can be divided into a number of subsystems, as follows.
//!
//! ## User Interactions
//!
//! TODO
//!
//! ## Session and Era Rotation
//!
//! TODO
//!
//! ## Exposure Collection
//!
//! TODO
//!
//! ## Slashing Pipeline and Withdrawal Restrictions
//!
//! This pallet implements a robust slashing mechanism that ensures the integrity of the staking
//! system while preventing stakers from withdrawing funds that might still be subject to slashing.
//!
//! ### Overview of the Slashing Pipeline
//!
//! The slashing process consists of multiple phases:
//!
//! 1. **Offence Reporting**: Offences are reported from the relay chain through `on_new_offences`
//! 2. **Queuing**: Valid offences are added to the `OffenceQueue` for processing
//! 3. **Processing**: Offences are processed incrementally over multiple blocks
//! 4. **Application**: Slashes are either applied immediately or deferred based on configuration
//!
//! ### Phase 1: Offence Reporting
//!
//! Offences are reported from the relay chain (e.g., from BABE, GRANDPA, BEEFY, or parachain
//! modules) through the `on_new_offences` function:
//!
//! ```text
//! struct Offence {
//!     offender: AccountId,        // The validator being slashed
//!     reporters: Vec<AccountId>,  // Who reported the offence (may be empty)
//!     slash_fraction: Perbill,    // Percentage of stake to slash
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! **Reporting Deadlines**:
//! - With deferred slashing: Offences must be reported within `SlashDeferDuration - 1` eras
//! - With immediate slashing: Offences can be reported up to `BondingDuration` eras old
//!
//! Example: If `SlashDeferDuration = 27` and current era is 100:
//! - Oldest reportable offence: Era 74 (100 - 26)
//! - Offences from era 73 or earlier are rejected
//!
//! ### Phase 2: Queuing
//!
//! When an offence passes validation, it's added to the queue:
//!
//! 1. **Storage**: Added to `OffenceQueue`: `(EraIndex, AccountId) -> OffenceRecord`
//! 2. **Era Tracking**: Era added to `OffenceQueueEras` (sorted vector of eras with offences)
//! 3. **Duplicate Handling**: If an offence already exists for the same validator in the same era,
//!    only the higher slash fraction is kept
//!
//! ### Phase 3: Processing
//!
//! Offences are processed incrementally in `on_initialize` each block:
//!
//! ```text
//! 1. Load oldest offence from queue
//! 2. Move to `ProcessingOffence` storage
//! 3. For each exposure page (from last to first):
//!    - Calculate slash for validator's own stake
//!    - Calculate slash for each nominator (pro-rata based on exposure)
//!    - Track total slash and reward amounts
//! 4. Once all pages processed, create `UnappliedSlash`
//! ```
//!
//! **Key Features**:
//! - **Page-by-page processing**: Large validator sets don't overwhelm a single block
//! - **Pro-rata slashing**: Nominators slashed proportionally to their stake
//! - **Reward calculation**: A portion goes to reporters (if any)
//!
//! ### Phase 4: Application
//!
//! Based on `SlashDeferDuration`, slashes are either:
//!
//! **Immediate (SlashDeferDuration = 0)**:
//! - Applied right away in the same block
//! - Funds deducted from staking ledger immediately
//!
//! **Deferred (SlashDeferDuration > 0)**:
//! - Stored in `UnappliedSlashes` for future application
//! - Applied at era: `offence_era + SlashDeferDuration`
//! - Can be cancelled by governance before application
//!
//! ### Storage Items Involved
//!
//! - `OffenceQueue`: Pending offences to process
//! - `OffenceQueueEras`: Sorted list of eras with offences
//! - `ProcessingOffence`: Currently processing offence
//! - `ValidatorSlashInEra`: Tracks highest slash per validator per era
//! - `UnappliedSlashes`: Deferred slashes waiting for application
//!
//! ### Withdrawal Restrictions
//!
//! To maintain slashing guarantees, withdrawals are restricted:
//!
//! **Withdrawal Era Calculation**:
//! ```text
//! earliest_era_to_withdraw = min(
//!     active_era,
//!     last_fully_processed_offence_era + BondingDuration
//! )
//! ```
//!
//! **Example**:
//! - Active era: 100
//! - Oldest unprocessed offence: Era 70
//! - BondingDuration: 28
//! - Withdrawal allowed only for chunks with era ≤ 97 (70 - 1 + 28)
//!
//! **Withdrawal Timeline Example with an Offence**:
//! ```text
//! Era:        90    91    92    93    94    95    96    97    98    99    100   ...  117   118
//!             |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |          |     |
//! Unbond:     U                                                                             
//! Offence:    X                                                                             
//! Reported:               R                                                                 
//! Processed:              P (within next few blocks)                                        
//! Slash Applied:                                                                       S     
//! Withdraw:                                                                            ❌    ✓
//!
//! With BondingDuration = 28 and SlashDeferDuration = 27:
//! - User unbonds in era 90
//! - Offence occurs in era 90
//! - Reported in era 92 (typically within 2 days, but reportable until Era 116)
//! - Processed in era 92 (within next few blocks after reporting)
//! - Slash deferred for 27 eras, applied at era 117 (90 + 27)
//! - Cannot withdraw unbonded chunks until era 118 (90 + 28)
//!
//! The 28-era bonding duration ensures that any offences committed before or during
//! unbonding have time to be reported, processed, and applied before funds can be
//! withdrawn. This provides a window for governance to cancel slashes that may have
//! resulted from software bugs.
//! ```
//!
//! **Key Restrictions**:
//! 1. Cannot withdraw if previous era has unapplied slashes
//! 2. Cannot withdraw funds from eras with unprocessed offences
