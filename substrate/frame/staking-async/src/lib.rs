//! # Staking Async Pallet
//!
//! This pallet is a fork of the original `pallet-staking`, with a number of key differences:
//!
//! * It no longer has access to a secure timestamp, previously used to calculate the duration of an
//!   era.
//! * It no longer has access to a pallet-session.
//! * It no longer has access to a pallet-authorship.
//! * It is capable of working with a multi-page `ElectionProvider``, aka.
//!   `pallet-election-provider-multi-block`.
//!
//! While `pallet-staking` was somewhat general-purpose, this pallet is absolutely NOT right from
//! the get-go: It is designed to be used ONLY in Polkadot/Kusama AssetHub system parachains.
//!
//! The workings of this pallet can be divided into a number of subsystems, as follows.
//!
//! ## User Interactions
//!
//! TODO
//!
//! ## Session and Era Rotation
//!
//! TODO
//!
//! ## Exposure Collection
//!
//! TODO
//!
//! ## Slashing of Validators and Exposures
//!
//! TODO
