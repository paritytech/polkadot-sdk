<p>This document aims to describe the purpose, functionality, and implementation of the host for Polkadot's <em>parachains</em>
functionality - that is, the software which provides security and advancement for constituent parachains. It is not for
the implementer of a specific parachain but rather for the implementer of the Parachain Host. In practice, this is for
the implementers of Polkadot in general.</p>
<p>There are a number of other documents describing the research in more detail. All referenced documents will be linked
here and should be read alongside this document for the best understanding of the full picture. However, this is the
only document which aims to describe key aspects of Polkadot's particular instantiation of much of that research down to
low-level technical details and software architecture.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="whence-parachains"><a class="header" href="#whence-parachains">Whence Parachains</a></h1>
<p>Parachains are the solution to a problem. As with any solution, it cannot be understood without first understanding the
problem. So let's start by going over the issues faced by blockchain technology that led to us beginning to explore the
design space for something like parachains.</p>
<h2 id="issue-1-scalability"><a class="header" href="#issue-1-scalability">Issue 1: Scalability</a></h2>
<p>It became clear a few years ago that the transaction throughput of simple Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains such as
Bitcoin, Ethereum, and myriad others was simply too low.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: what if there were more blockchains, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems can accomplish higher throughput than PoW blockchains. PoS systems are secured by bonded
capital as opposed to spent effort - liquidity opportunity cost vs. burning electricity. The way they work is by
selecting a set of validators with known economic identity who lock up tokens in exchange for earning the right to
&quot;validate&quot; or participate in the consensus process. If they are found to carry out that process wrongly, they will be
slashed, meaning some or all of the locked tokens will be burned. This provides a strong disincentive in the direction
of misbehavior.</p>
<p>Since the consensus protocol doesn't revolve around wasting effort, block times and agreement can occur much faster.
Solutions to PoW challenges don't have to be found before a block can be authored, so the overhead of authoring a block
is reduced to only the costs of creating and distributing the block.</p>
<p>However, consensus on a PoS chain requires full agreement of 2/3+ of the validator set for everything that occurs at
Layer 1: all logic which is carried out as part of the blockchain's state machine. This means that everybody still needs
to check everything. Furthermore, validators may have different views of the system based on the information that they
receive over an asynchronous network, making agreement on the latest state more difficult.</p>
<p>Parachains are an example of a <strong>sharded</strong> protocol. Sharding is a concept borrowed from traditional database
architecture. Rather than requiring every participant to check every transaction, we require each participant to check
some subset of transactions, with enough redundancy baked in that byzantine (arbitrarily malicious) participants can't
sneak in invalid transactions - at least not without being detected and getting slashed, with those transactions
reverted.</p>
<p>Sharding and Proof-of-Stake in coordination with each other allow a parachain host to provide full security on many
parachains, even without all participants checking all state transitions.</p>

<p>TODO: note about network effects &amp; bridging</p>

<p>&quot;dumb&quot; VMs don't give you the flexibility. Any engineer knows that being able to specialize on a problem gives them and
their users more <em>leverage</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: expand on leverage</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having recognized these issues, we set out to find a solution to these problems, which could allow developers to create
and deploy purpose-built blockchains unified under a common source of security, with the capability of message-passing
between them; a <em>heterogeneous sharding solution</em>, which we have come to know as <strong>Parachains</strong>.</p>

<p>This section aims to describe, at a high level, the actors and protocols involved in running parachains in Polkadot.
Specifically, we describe how different actors communicate with each other, what data structures they keep both
individually and collectively, and the high-level purpose on why they do these things.</p>
<p>Our top-level goal is to carry a parachain block from authoring to secure inclusion, and define a process which can be
carried out repeatedly and in parallel for many different parachains to extend them over time. Understanding of the
high-level approach taken here is important to provide context for the proposed architecture further on. The key parts
of Polkadot relevant to this are the main Polkadot blockchain, known as the relay-chain, and the actors which provide
security and inputs to this blockchain.</p>
<p>First, it's important to go over the main actors we have involved in this protocol.</p>
<ol>
<li>Validators. These nodes are responsible for validating proposed parachain blocks. They do so by checking a
Proof-of-Validity (PoV) of the block and ensuring that the PoV remains available. They put financial capital down as
&quot;skin in the game&quot; which can be slashed (destroyed) if they are proven to have misvalidated.</li>
<li>Collators. These nodes are responsible for creating the Proofs-of-Validity that validators know how to check.
Creating a PoV typically requires familiarity with the transaction format and block authoring rules of the parachain,
as well as having access to the full state of the parachain.</li>
</ol>
<p>This implies a simple pipeline where collators send validators parachain blocks and their requisite PoV to check. Then,
validators validate the block using the PoV, signing statements which describe either the positive or negative outcome,
and with enough positive statements, the block can be noted on the relay-chain. Negative statements are not a veto but
will lead to a dispute, with those on the wrong side being slashed. If another validator later detects that a validator
or group of validators incorrectly signed a statement claiming a block was valid, then those validators will be
<em>slashed</em>, with the checker receiving a bounty.</p>
<p>However, there is a problem with this formulation. In order for another validator to check the previous group of
validators' work after the fact, the PoV must remain <em>available</em> so the other validator can fetch it in order to check
the work. The PoVs are expected to be too large to include in the blockchain directly, so we require an alternate <em>data
availability</em> scheme which requires validators to prove that the inputs to their work will remain available, and so
their work can be checked. Empirical tests tell us that many PoVs may be between 1 and 10MB during periods of heavy
load.</p>
<p>Here is a description of the Inclusion Pipeline: the path a parachain block (or parablock, for short) takes from
creation to inclusion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Validators are selected and assigned to parachains by the Validator Assignment routine.</li>
<li>A collator produces the parachain block, which is known as a parachain candidate or candidate, along with a PoV for
the candidate.</li>
<li>The collator forwards the candidate and PoV to validators assigned to the same parachain via the <a href="node/collators/collator-protocol.html">Collator
Protocol</a>.</li>
<li>The validators assigned to a parachain at a given point in time participate in the <a href="node/backing/candidate-backing.html">Candidate Backing
subsystem</a> to validate candidates that were put forward for validation. Candidates
which gather enough signed validity statements from validators are considered &quot;backable&quot;. Their backing is the set of
signed validity statements.</li>
<li>A relay-chain block author, selected by BABE, can note up to one (1) backable candidate for each parachain to include
in the relay-chain block alongside its backing. A backable candidate once included in the relay-chain is considered
backed in that fork of the relay-chain.</li>
<li>Once backed in the relay-chain, the parachain candidate is considered to be &quot;pending availability&quot;. It is not
considered to be included as part of the parachain until it is proven available.</li>
<li>In the following relay-chain blocks, validators will participate in the <a href="node/availability/availability-distribution.html">Availability Distribution
subsystem</a> to ensure availability of the candidate. Information
regarding the availability of the candidate will be noted in the subsequent relay-chain blocks.</li>
<li>Once the relay-chain state machine has enough information to consider the candidate's PoV as being available, the
candidate is considered to be part of the parachain and is graduated to being a full parachain block, or parablock
for short.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the candidate can fail to be included in any of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The collator is not able to propagate the candidate to any validators assigned to the parachain.</li>
<li>The candidate is not backed by validators participating in the Candidate Backing Subsystem.</li>
<li>The candidate is not selected by a relay-chain block author to be included in the relay chain</li>
<li>The candidate's PoV is not considered as available within a timeout and is discarded from the relay chain.</li>
</ul>
<p>This process can be divided further down. Steps 2 &amp; 3 relate to the work of the collator in collating and distributing
the candidate to validators via the Collation Distribution Subsystem. Steps 3 &amp; 4 relate to the work of the validators
in the Candidate Backing Subsystem and the block author (itself a validator) to include the block into the relay chain.
Steps 6, 7, and 8 correspond to the logic of the relay-chain state-machine (otherwise known as the Runtime) used to
fully incorporate the block into the chain. Step 7 requires further work on the validators' parts to participate in the
Availability Distribution Subsystem and include that information into the relay chain for step 8 to be fully realized.</p>
<p>This brings us to the second part of the process. Once a parablock is considered available and part of the parachain, it
is still &quot;pending approval&quot;. At this stage in the pipeline, the parablock has been backed by a majority of validators in
the group assigned to that parachain, and its data has been guaranteed available by the set of validators as a whole.
Once it's considered available, the host will even begin to accept children of that block. At this point, we can
consider the parablock as having been tentatively included in the parachain, although more confirmations are desired.
However, the validators in the parachain-group (known as the &quot;Parachain Validators&quot; for that parachain) are sampled from
a validator set which contains some proportion of byzantine, or arbitrarily malicious members. This implies that the
Parachain Validators for some parachain may be majority-dishonest, which means that (secondary) approval checks must be
done on the block before it can be considered approved. This is necessary only because the Parachain Validators for a
given parachain are sampled from an overall validator set which is assumed to be up to &lt;1/3 dishonest - meaning that
there is a chance to randomly sample Parachain Validators for a parachain that are majority or fully dishonest and can
back a candidate wrongly. The Approval Process allows us to detect such misbehavior after-the-fact without allocating
more Parachain Validators and reducing the throughput of the system. A parablock's failure to pass the approval process
will invalidate the block as well as all of its descendants. However, only the validators who backed the block in
question will be slashed, not the validators who backed the descendants.</p>
<p>The Approval Process, at a glance, looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Parablocks that have been included by the Inclusion Pipeline are pending approval for a time-window known as the
secondary checking window.</li>
<li>During the secondary-checking window, validators randomly self-select to perform secondary checks on the parablock.</li>
<li>These validators, known in this context as secondary checkers, acquire the parablock and its PoV, and re-run the
validation function.</li>
<li>The secondary checkers gossip the result of their checks. Contradictory results lead to escalation, where all
validators are required to check the block. The validators on the losing side of the dispute are slashed.</li>
<li>At the end of the Approval Process, the parablock is either Approved or it is rejected. More on the rejection process
later.</li>
</ol>
<p>More information on the Approval Process can be found in the dedicated section on <a href="protocol-approval.html">Approval</a>. More
information on Disputes can be found in the dedicated section on <a href="protocol-disputes.html">Disputes</a>.</p>
<p>These two pipelines sum up the sequence of events necessary to extend and acquire full security on a Parablock. Note
that the Inclusion Pipeline must conclude for a specific parachain before a new block can be accepted on that parachain.
After inclusion, the Approval Process kicks off, and can be running for many parachain blocks at once.</p>
<p>Reiterating the lifecycle of a candidate:</p>
<ol>
<li>Candidate: put forward by a collator to a validator.</li>
<li>Seconded: put forward by a validator to other validators</li>
<li>Backable: validity attested to by a majority of assigned validators</li>
<li>Backed: Backable &amp; noted in a fork of the relay-chain.</li>
<li>Pending availability: Backed but not yet considered available.</li>
<li>Included: Backed and considered available.</li>
<li>Accepted: Backed, available, and undisputed</li>
</ol>

<p>The diagram above shows the happy path of a block from (1) Candidate to the (7) Approved state.</p>
<p>It is also important to take note of the fact that the relay-chain is extended by BABE, which is a forkful algorithm.
That means that different block authors can be chosen at the same time, and may not be building on the same block
parent. Furthermore, the set of validators is not fixed, nor is the set of parachains. And even with the same set of
validators and parachains, the validators' assignments to parachains is flexible. This means that the architecture
proposed in the next chapters must deal with the variability and multiplicity of the network state.</p>

<p>In this example, group 1 has received block C while the others have not due to network asynchrony. Now, a validator from
group 2 may be able to build another block on top of B, called <code>C'</code>. Assume that afterwards, some validators become
aware of both C and <code>C'</code>, while others remain only aware of one.</p>

<p>Those validators that are aware of many competing heads must be aware of the work happening on each one. They may
contribute to some or a full extent on both. It is possible that due to network asynchrony two forks may grow in
parallel for some time, although in the absence of an adversarial network this is unlikely in the case where there are
validators who are aware of both chain heads.</p>
<footer id="last-change">Last change: 2023-09-04, commit: <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/commit/a30092ab42">a30092ab42</a></footer><div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="approval-process"><a class="header" href="#approval-process">Approval Process</a></h1>
<p>The Approval Process is the mechanism by which the relay-chain ensures that only valid parablocks are finalized and that
backing validators are held accountable for managing to get bad blocks included into the relay chain.</p>
<p>Having a parachain include a bad block into a fork of the relay-chain is not catastrophic as long as the block isn't
finalized by the relay-chain's finality gadget, GRANDPA. If the block isn't finalized, that means that the fork of the
relay-chain can be reverted in favor of another by means of a dynamic fork-choice rule which leads honest validators to
ignore any forks containing that parablock.</p>
<p>Dealing with a bad parablock proceeds in these stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Detection</li>
<li>Escalation</li>
<li>Consequences</li>
</ol>
<p>First, the bad block must be detected by an honest party. Second, the honest party must escalate the bad block to be
checked by all validators. And last, the correct consequences of a bad block must occur. The first consequence, as
mentioned above, is to revert the chain so what full nodes perceive to be best no longer contains the bad parablock. The
second consequence is to slash all malicious validators. Note that, if the chain containing the bad block is reverted,
that the result of the dispute needs to be transplanted or at least transplantable to all other forks of the chain so
that malicious validators are slashed in all possible histories. Phrased alternatively, there needs to be no possible
relay-chain in which malicious validators get away cost-free.</p>
<p>Accepting a parablock is the end result of having passed through the detection stage without dispute, or having passed
through the escalation/dispute stage with a positive outcome. For this to work, we need the detection procedure to have
the properties that enough honest validators are always selected to check the parablock and that they cannot be
interfered with by an adversary. This needs to be balanced with the scaling concern of parachains in general: the
easiest way to get the first property is to have everyone check everything, but that is clearly too heavy. So we also
have a desired constraint on the other property that we have as few validators as possible check any particular
parablock. Our assignment function is the method by which we select validators to do approval checks on parablocks.</p>
<p>It often makes more sense to think of relay-chain blocks as having been approved or not as opposed to thinking about
whether parablocks have been approved. A relay-chain block containing a single bad parablock needs to be reverted, and a
relay-chain block that contains only approved parablocks can be called approved, as long as its parent relay-chain block
is also approved. It is important that the validity of any particular relay-chain block depend on the validity of its
ancestry, so we do not finalize a block which has a bad block in its ancestry.</p>

<p>Approval has roughly two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Assignments</strong> determines which validators performs approval checks on which candidates.  It ensures that each
candidate receives enough random checkers, while reducing adversaries' odds for obtaining enough checkers, and
limiting adversaries' foreknowledge.  It tracks approval votes to identify when &quot;no show&quot; approval check takes
suspiciously long, perhaps indicating the node being under attack, and assigns more checks in this case.  It tracks
relay chain equivocations to determine when adversaries possibly gained foreknowledge about assignments, and adds
additional checks in this case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Approval checks</strong> listens to the assignments subsystem for outgoing assignment notices that we shall check specific
candidates.  It then performs these checks by first invoking the reconstruction subsystem to obtain the candidate,
second invoking the candidate validity utility subsystem upon the candidate, and finally sending out an approval vote,
or perhaps initiating a dispute.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These both run first as off-chain consensus protocols using messages gossiped among all validators, and second as an
on-chain record of this off-chain protocols' progress after the fact.  We need the on-chain protocol to provide rewards
for the off-chain protocol.</p>
<p>Approval requires two gossiped message types, assignment notices created by its assignments subsystem, and approval
votes sent by our approval checks subsystem when authorized by the candidate validity utility subsystem.</p>
<h2 id="approval-keys"><a class="header" href="#approval-keys">Approval keys</a></h2>
<p>We need two separate keys for the approval subsystem:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Approval assignment keys</strong> are sr25519/schnorrkel keys used only for the assignment criteria VRFs.  We implicitly
sign assignment notices with approval assignment keys by including their relay chain context and additional data in
the VRF's extra message, but exclude these from its VRF input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Approval vote keys</strong> would only sign off on candidate parablock validity and has no natural key type restrictions.
There's no need for this to actually embody a new session key type. We just want to make a distinction between
assignments and approvals, although distant future node configurations might favor separate roles. We re-use the same
keys as are used for parachain backing in practice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Approval vote keys could relatively easily be handled by some hardened signer tooling, perhaps even HSMs assuming we
select ed25519 for approval vote keys.  Approval assignment keys might or might not support hardened signer tooling, but
doing so sounds far more complex.  In fact, assignment keys determine only VRF outputs that determine approval checker
assignments, for which they can only act or not act, so they cannot equivocate, lie, etc. and represent little if any
slashing risk for validator operators.</p>
<p>In future, we shall determine which among the several hardening techniques best benefits the network as a whole.  We
could provide a multi-process multi-machine architecture for validators, perhaps even reminiscent of GNUNet, or perhaps
more resembling smart HSM tooling.  We might instead design a system that more resembled full systems, like like Cosmos'
sentry nodes.  In either case, approval assignments might be handled by a slightly hardened machine, but not necessarily
nearly as hardened as approval votes, but approval votes machines must similarly run foreign WASM code, which increases
their risk, so assignments being separate sounds helpful.</p>
<h2 id="assignments"><a class="header" href="#assignments">Assignments</a></h2>
<p>Approval assignment determines on which candidate parachain blocks each validator performs approval checks.  An approval
session considers only one relay chain block and assigns only those candidates that relay chain block declares
available.</p>
<p>Assignment balances several concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>limits adversaries' foreknowledge about assignments,</li>
<li>ensures enough checkers, and</li>
<li>distributes assignments relatively equitably.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assignees determine their own assignments to check specific candidates using two or three assignment criteria.
Assignees never reveal their assignments until relevant, and gossip delays assignments sent early, which limits others'
foreknowledge.  Assignees learn their assignment only with the relay chain block.</p>
<p>All criteria require the validator evaluate a verifiable random function (VRF) using their VRF secret key.  All criteria
input specific data called &quot;stories&quot; about the session's relay chain block, and output candidates to check and a
precedence called a <code>DelayTranche</code>.</p>
<p>We liberate availability cores when their candidate becomes available of course, but one approval assignment criteria
continues associating each candidate with the core number it occupied when it became available.</p>
<p>Assignment operates in loosely timed rounds determined by this <code>DelayTranche</code>s, which proceed roughly 12 times faster
than six second block production assuming half second gossip times.  If a candidate <code>C</code> needs more approval checkers by
the time we reach round <code>t</code> then any validators with an assignment to <code>C</code> in delay tranche <code>t</code> gossip their send
assignment notice for <code>C</code>.  We continue until all candidates have enough approval checkers assigned.  We take entire
tranches together if we do not yet have enough, so we expect strictly more than enough checkers.  We also take later
tranches if some checkers return their approval votes too slow (see no shows below).</p>
<p>Assignment ensures validators check those relay chain blocks for which they have delay tranche zero aka the highest
precedence, so that adversaries always face honest checkers equal to the expected number of assignments with delay
tranche zero.</p>
<p>Among these criteria, the BABE VRF output provides the story for two, which reduces how frequently adversaries could
position their own checkers.  We have one criterion whose story consists of the candidate's block hash plus external
knowledge that a relay chain equivocation exists with a conflicting candidate.  It provides unforeseeable assignments
when adversaries gain foreknowledge about the other two by committing an equivocation in relay chain block production.</p>
<h2 id="announcements--notices"><a class="header" href="#announcements--notices">Announcements / Notices</a></h2>
<p>We gossip assignment notices among nodes so that all validators know which validators should check each candidate, and
if any candidate requires more checkers.</p>
<p>Assignment notices consist of a relay chain context given by a block hash, an assignment criteria, consisting of the
criteria identifier and optionally a criteria specific field, an assignee identifier, and a VRF signature by the
assignee, which itself consists of a VRF pre-output and a DLEQ proof.  Its VRF input consists of the criteria, usually
including a criteria specific field, and a &quot;story&quot; about its relay chain context block.</p>
<p>We never include stories inside the gossip messages containing assignment notices, but require each validator
reconstruct them.  We never care about assignments in the disputes process, so this does not complicate remote disputes.</p>
<p>In a Schnorr VRF, there is an extra signed message distinct from this input, which we set to the relay chain block hash.
As a result, assignment notices are self signing and can be &quot;politely&quot; gossiped without additional signatures, meaning
between nodes who can compute the story from the relay chain context.  In other words, if we cannot compute the story
required by an assignment notice's VRF part then our self signing property fails and we cannot verify its origin.  We
could fix this with either another signature layer (64 bytes) or by including the VRF input point computed from the
story (32 bytes), but doing so appears unhelpful.</p>
<p>Any validator could send their assignment notices and/or approval votes too early.  We gossip the approval votes early
because they represent a major commitment by the validator.  We delay gossiping the assignment notices until they agree
with our local clock however.  We also impose a politeness condition that the recipient knows the relay chain context
used by the assignment notice.</p>
<h2 id="stories"><a class="header" href="#stories">Stories</a></h2>
<p>We based assignment criteria upon two possible &quot;stories&quot; about the relay chain block <code>R</code> that included the candidate aka
declared the candidate available.  All stories have an output that attempts to minimize adversarial influence, which
then acts as the VRF input for an assignment criteria.</p>
<p>We first have a <code>RelayVRFStory</code> that outputs the randomness from another VRF output produced by the relay chain block
producer when creating <code>R</code>.  Among honest nodes, only this one relay chain block producer who creates <code>R</code> knew the story
in advance, and even they knew nothing two epochs previously.</p>
<p>In BABE, we create this value calling <code>schnorrkel::vrf::VRFInOut::make_bytes</code> with a context &quot;A&amp;V RC-VRF&quot;, with the
<code>VRFInOut</code> coming from either the VRF that authorized block production for primary blocks, or else from the secondary
block VRF for the secondary block type.</p>
<p>In Sassafras, we shall always use the non-anonymized recycling VRF output, never the anonymized ring VRF that authorizes
block production.  We do not currently know if Sassafras shall have a separate schnorrkel key, but if it reuses its ring
VRF key there is an equivalent <code>ring_vrf::VRFInOut::make_bytes</code>.</p>
<p>We like that <code>RelayVRFStory</code> admits relatively few choices, but an adversary who equivocates in relay chain block
production could learn assignments that depend upon the <code>RelayVRFStory</code> too early because the same relay chain VRF
appears in multiple blocks.</p>
<p>We therefore provide a secondary <code>RelayEquivocationStory</code> that outputs the candidate's block hash, but only for
candidate equivocations.  We say a candidate <code>C</code> in <code>R</code> is an equivocation when there exists another relay chain block
<code>R1</code> that equivocates for <code>R</code> in the sense that <code>R</code> and <code>R1</code> have the same <code>RelayVRFStory</code>, but <code>R</code> contains <code>C</code> and
<code>R1</code> does not contain <code>C</code>.</p>
<p>We want checkers for candidate equivocations that lie outside our preferred relay chain as well, which represents a
slightly different usage for the assignments module, and might require more information in the gossip messages.</p>
<h2 id="assignment-criteria"><a class="header" href="#assignment-criteria">Assignment criteria</a></h2>
<p>Assignment criteria compute actual assignments using stories and the validators' secret approval assignment key.
Assignment criteria output a <code>Position</code> consisting of both a <code>ParaId</code> to be checked, as well as a precedence
<code>DelayTranche</code> for when the assignment becomes valid.</p>
<p>Assignment criteria come in three flavors, <code>RelayVRFModulo</code>, <code>RelayVRFDelay</code> and <code>RelayEquivocation</code>.  Among these, both
<code>RelayVRFModulo</code> and <code>RelayVRFDelay</code> run a VRF whose input is the output of a <code>RelayVRFStory</code>, while <code>RelayEquivocation</code>
runs a VRF whose input is the output of a <code>RelayEquivocationStory</code>.</p>
<p>Among these, we have two distinct VRF output computations:</p>
<p><code>RelayVRFModulo</code> runs several distinct samples whose VRF input is the <code>RelayVRFStory</code> and the sample number.  It
computes the VRF output with <code>schnorrkel::vrf::VRFInOut::make_bytes</code> using the context &quot;A&amp;V Core&quot;, reduces this number
modulo the number of availability cores, and outputs the candidate just declared available by, and included by aka
leaving, that availability core.  We drop any samples that return no candidate because no candidate was leaving the
sampled availability core in this relay chain block.  We choose three samples initially, but we could make Polkadot more
secure and efficient by increasing this to four or five, and reducing the backing checks accordingly.  All successful
<code>RelayVRFModulo</code> samples are assigned delay tranche zero.</p>
<p>There is no sampling process for <code>RelayVRFDelay</code> and <code>RelayEquivocation</code>.  We instead run them on specific candidates
and they compute a delay from their VRF output.  <code>RelayVRFDelay</code> runs for all candidates included under, aka declared
available by, a relay chain block, and inputs the associated VRF output via <code>RelayVRFStory</code>.  <code>RelayEquivocation</code> runs
only on candidate block equivocations, and inputs their block hashes via the <code>RelayEquivocation</code> story.</p>
<p><code>RelayVRFDelay</code> and <code>RelayEquivocation</code> both compute their output with <code>schnorrkel::vrf::VRFInOut::make_bytes</code> using the
context &quot;A&amp;V Tranche&quot; and reduce the result modulo <code>num_delay_tranches + zeroth_delay_tranche_width</code>, and consolidate
results 0 through <code>zeroth_delay_tranche_width</code> to be 0.  In this way, they ensure the zeroth delay tranche has
<code>zeroth_delay_tranche_width+1</code> times as many assignments as any other tranche.</p>
<p>As future work (or TODO?), we should merge assignment notices with the same delay and story using <code>vrf_merge</code>.  We
cannot merge those with the same delay and different stories because <code>RelayEquivocationStory</code>s could change but
<code>RelayVRFStory</code> never changes.</p>
<h2 id="announcer-and-watchertracker"><a class="header" href="#announcer-and-watchertracker">Announcer and Watcher/Tracker</a></h2>
<p>We track all validators' announced approval assignments for each candidate associated to each relay chain block, which
tells us which validators were assigned to which candidates.</p>
<p>We permit at most one assignment per candidate per story per validator, so one validator could be assigned under both
the <code>RelayVRFDelay</code> and <code>RelayEquivocation</code> criteria, but not under both <code>RelayVRFModulo</code> and <code>RelayVRFDelay</code> criteria,
since those both use the same story.  We permit only one approval vote per candidate per validator, which counts for any
applicable criteria.</p>
<p>We announce, and start checking for, our own assignments when the delay of their tranche is reached, but only if the
tracker says the assignee candidate requires more approval checkers.  We never announce an assignment we believe
unnecessary because early announcements gives an adversary information.  All delay tranche zero assignments always get
announced, which includes all <code>RelayVRFModulo</code> assignments.</p>
<p>In other words, if some candidate <code>C</code> needs more approval checkers by the time we reach round <code>t</code> then any validators
with an assignment to <code>C</code> in delay tranche <code>t</code> gossip their send assignment notice for <code>C</code>, and begin reconstruction and
validation for 'C.  If however <code>C</code> reached enough assignments, then validators with later assignments skip announcing
their assignments.</p>
<p>We continue until all candidates have enough approval checkers assigned.  We never prioritize assignments within
tranches and count all or no assignments for a given tranche together, so we often overshoot the target number of
assigned approval checkers.</p>
<h3 id="no-shows"><a class="header" href="#no-shows">No shows</a></h3>
<p>We have a &quot;no show&quot; timeout longer than one relay chain slot, so at least 6 seconds, during which we expect approval
checks should succeed in reconstructing the candidate block, in redoing its erasure coding to check the candidate
receipt, and finally in rechecking the candidate block itself.</p>
<p>We consider a validator a &quot;no show&quot; if they do not approve or dispute within this &quot;no show&quot; timeout from our receiving
their assignment notice.  We time this from our receipt of their assignment notice instead of our imagined real time for
their tranche because otherwise receiving late assignment notices creates immediate &quot;no shows&quot; and unnecessary work.</p>
<p>We worry &quot;no shows&quot; represent a validator under denial of service attack, presumably to prevent it from reconstructing
the candidate, but perhaps delaying it form gossiping a dispute too.  We therefore always replace &quot;no shows&quot; by adding
one entire extra delay tranche worth of validators, so such attacks always result in additional checkers.</p>
<p>As an example, imagine we need 20 checkers, but tranche zero produces only 14, and tranche one only 4, then we take all
5 from tranche two, and thus require 23 checkers for that candidate.  If one checker Charlie from tranche one or two
does not respond within say 8 seconds, then we add all 7 checkers from tranche three.  If again one checker Cindy from
tranche three does not respond within 8 seconds then we take all 3 checkers from tranche four.  We now have 33 checkers
working on the candidate, so this escalated quickly.</p>
<p>We escalated so quickly because we worried that Charlie and Cindy might be the only honest checkers assigned to that
candidate.  If therefore either Charlie or Cindy finally return an approval, then we can conclude approval, and abandon
the checkers from tranche four.</p>
<p>We therefore require the &quot;no show&quot; timeout to be longer than a relay chain slot so that we can witness &quot;no shows&quot;
on-chain.  We discuss below how this helps reward validators who replace &quot;no shows&quot;.</p>
<p>We avoid slashing for &quot;no shows&quot; by itself, although being &quot;no show&quot; could enter into some computation that punishes
repeated poor performance, presumably replaces <code>ImOnline</code>, and we could reduce their rewards and further rewards those
who filled in.</p>
<p>As future work, we foresee expanding the &quot;no show&quot; scheme to anonymize the additional checkers, like by using assignment
noticed with a new criteria that employs a ring VRF and then all validators providing cover by requesting a couple
erasure coded pieces, but such anonymity scheme sound extremely complex and lie far beyond our initial functionality.</p>
<h2 id="assignment-postponement"><a class="header" href="#assignment-postponement">Assignment postponement</a></h2>
<p>We expect validators could occasionally overloaded when they randomly acquire too many assignments.  All these
fluctuations amortize over multiple blocks fairly well, but this slows down finality.</p>
<p>We therefore permit validators to delay sending their assignment noticed intentionally.  If nobody knows about their
assignment then they avoid creating &quot;no shows&quot; and the workload progresses normally.</p>
<p>We strongly prefer if postponements come from tranches higher aka less important than zero because tranche zero checks
provide somewhat more security.</p>
<p>TODO: When?  Is this optimal for the network?  etc.</p>
<h2 id="on-chain-verification"><a class="header" href="#on-chain-verification">On-chain verification</a></h2>
<p>We should verify approval on-chain to reward approval checkers. We therefore require the &quot;no show&quot; timeout to be longer
than a relay chain slot so that we can witness &quot;no shows&quot; on-chain, which helps with this goal. The major challenge with
an on-chain record of the off-chain process is adversarial block producers who may either censor votes or publish votes
to the chain which cause other votes to be ignored and unrewarded (reward stealing).</p>
<p>In principle, all validators have some &quot;tranche&quot; at which they're assigned to the parachain candidate, which ensures we
reach enough validators eventually.  As noted above, we often retract &quot;no shows&quot; when the slow validator eventually
shows up, so witnessing their initially being a &quot;no show&quot; helps manage rewards.</p>
<p>We expect on-chain verification should work in two phases:  We first record assignments notices and approval votes
on-chain in relay chain block, doing the VRF or regular signature verification again in block verification, and
inserting chain authenticated unsigned notes into the relay chain state that contain the checker, tranche, paraid, and
relay block height for each assignment notice.  We then later have another relay chain block that runs some &quot;approved&quot;
intrinsic, which extract all these notes from the state and feeds them into our approval code.</p>
<p>We now encounter one niche concern in the interaction between postponement and on-chain verification:  Any validator
with a tranche zero (or other low) assignment could delay sending an assignment notice, like because they postponed
their assigned tranche (which is allowed).  If they later send this assignment notices right around finality time, then
they race with this approved. intrinsic:  If their announcement gets on-chain (also allowed), then yes it delays
finality. If it does not get on-chain, then yes we've one announcement that the off-chain consensus system says is
valid, but the chain ignores for being too slow.</p>
<p>We need the chain to win in this case, but doing this requires imposing an annoyingly long overarching delay upon
finality.  We might explore limits on postponement too, but this sounds much harder.</p>
<h2 id="parameters"><a class="header" href="#parameters">Parameters</a></h2>
<p>We prefer doing approval checkers assignments under <code>RelayVRFModulo</code> as opposed to <code>RelayVRFDelay</code> because
<code>RelayVRFModulo</code> avoids giving individual checkers too many assignments and tranche zero assignments benefit security
the most.  We suggest assigning at least 16 checkers under <code>RelayVRFModulo</code> although assignment levels have never been
properly analyzed.</p>
<p>Our delay criteria <code>RelayVRFDelay</code> and <code>RelayEquivocation</code> both have two primary paramaters, expected checkers per
tranche and the zeroth delay tranche width.</p>
<p>We require expected checkers per tranche to be less than three because otherwise an adversary with 1/3 stake could force
all nodes into checking all blocks.  We strongly recommend expected checkers per tranche to be less than two, which
helps avoid both accidental and intentional explosions.  We also suggest expected checkers per tranche be larger than
one, which helps prevent adversaries from predicting than advancing one tranche adds only their own validators.</p>
<p>We improve security more with tranche zero assignments, so <code>RelayEquivocation</code> should consolidates its first several
tranches into tranche zero.  We describe this as the zeroth delay tranche width, which initially we set to 12 for
<code>RelayEquivocation</code> and <code>1</code> for <code>RelayVRFDelay</code>.</p>
<h2 id="why-vrfs"><a class="header" href="#why-vrfs">Why VRFs?</a></h2>
<p>We do assignments with VRFs to give &quot;enough&quot; checkers some meaning beyond merely &quot;expected&quot; checkers:</p>
<p>We could specify a protocol that used only system randomness, which works because our strongest defense is the expected
number of honest checkers who assign themselves.  In this, adversaries could trivially flood their own blocks with their
own checkers, so this strong defense becomes our only defense, and delay tranches become useless, so some blocks
actually have zero approval checkers and possibly only one checker overall.</p>
<p>VRFs though require adversaries wait far longer between such attacks, which also helps against adversaries with little
at stake because they compromised validators.  VRFs raise user confidence that no such &quot;drive by&quot; attacks occurred
because the delay tranche system ensure at least some minimum number of approval checkers.  In this vein, VRFs permit
reducing backing checks and increasing approval checks, which makes Polkadot more efficient.</p>
<h2 id="gossip"><a class="header" href="#gossip">Gossip</a></h2>
<p>Any validator could send their assignment notices and/or approval votes too early.  We gossip the approval votes because
they represent a major commitment by the validator.  We retain but delay gossiping the assignment notices until they
agree with our local clock.</p>
<p>Assignment notices being gossiped too early might create a denial of service vector.  If so, we might exploit the
relative time scheme that synchronizes our clocks, which conceivably permits just dropping excessively early
assignments.</p>
<h2 id="finality-grandpa-voting-rule"><a class="header" href="#finality-grandpa-voting-rule">Finality GRANDPA Voting Rule</a></h2>
<p>The relay-chain requires validators to participate in GRANDPA. In GRANDPA, validators submit off-chain votes on what
they believe to be the best block of the chain, and GRANDPA determines the common block contained by a supermajority of
sub-chains. There are also additional constraints on what can be submitted based on results of previous rounds of
voting.</p>
<p>In order to avoid finalizing anything which has not received enough approval votes or is disputed, we will pair the
approval protocol with an alteration to the GRANDPA voting strategy for honest nodes which causes them to vote only on
chains where every parachain candidate within has been approved.  Furthermore, the voting rule prevents voting for
chains where there is any live dispute or any dispute has resolved to a candidate being invalid.</p>
<p>Thus, the finalized relay-chain should contain only relay-chain blocks where a majority believe that every block within
has been sufficiently approved.</p>
<h3 id="future-work"><a class="header" href="#future-work">Future work</a></h3>
<p>We could consider additional gossip messages with which nodes claims &quot;slow availability&quot; and/or &quot;slow candidate&quot; to fine
tune the assignments &quot;no show&quot; system, but long enough &quot;no show&quot; delays suffice probably.</p>
<p>We shall develop more practical experience with UDP once the availability system works using direct UDP connections.  In
this, we should discover if reconstruction performs adequately with a complete graphs or benefits from topology
restrictions.  At this point, an assignment notices could implicitly request pieces from a random 1/3rd, perhaps
topology restricted, which saves one gossip round.  If this preliminary fast reconstruction fails, then nodes' request
alternative pieces directly.  There is an interesting design space in how this overlaps with &quot;slow availability&quot; claims.</p>

<p>Fast forward to <a href="./disputes-flow.html">more detailed disputes requirements</a>.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-and-background"><a class="header" href="#motivation-and-background">Motivation and Background</a></h2>
<p>All parachain blocks that end up in the finalized relay chain should be valid. This does not apply to blocks that are
only backed, but not included.</p>
<p>We have two primary components for ensuring that nothing invalid ends up in the finalized relay chain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Approval Checking, as described <a href="./protocol-approval.html">here</a> and implemented according to the <a href="node/approval/approval-voting.html">Approval
Voting</a> subsystem. This protocol can be shown to prevent invalid parachain blocks
from making their way into the finalized relay chain as long as the amount of attempts are limited.</li>
<li>Disputes, this protocol, which ensures that each attempt to include something bad is caught, and the offending
validators are punished. Disputes differ from backing and approval process (and can not be part of those) in that a
dispute is independent of a particular fork, while both backing and approval operate on particular forks. This
distinction is important! Approval voting stops, if an alternative fork which might not contain the currently approved
candidate gets finalized. This is totally fine from the perspective of approval voting as its sole purpose is to make
sure invalid blocks won't get finalized. For disputes on the other hand we have different requirements: Even though the
&quot;danger&quot; is past and the adversaries were not able to get their invalid block approved, we still want them to get
slashed for the attempt. Otherwise they just have been able to get a free try, but this is something we need to avoid in
our security model, as it is based on the assumption that the probability of getting an invalid block finalized is very
low and an attacker would get bankrupt before it could have tried often enough.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every dispute stems from a disagreement among two or more validators. If a bad actor creates a bad block, but the bad
actor never distributes it to honest validators, then nobody will dispute it. Of course, such a situation is not even an
attack on the network, so we don't need to worry about defending against it.</p>
<p>We are interested in identifying and deterring the following attack scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>A parablock included on a branch of the relay chain is bad</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also interested in identifying these additional scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>A parablock backed on a branch of the relay chain is bad</li>
<li>A parablock seconded, but not backed on any branch of the relay chain, is bad.</li>
</ul>
<p>Punishing misbehavior in the latter two scenarios doesn't effect our security guarantees and introduces substantial
technical challenges as described in the <code>No Disputes for Non Included Candidates</code> section of <a href="./node/disputes/dispute-coordinator.html">Dispute
Coordinator</a>. We therefore choose to punt on disputes in these cases, instead
favoring the protocol simplicity resulting from only punishing in the first scenario.</p>
<p>As covered in the <a href="./protocol-overview.html">protocol overview</a>, checking a parachain block requires 3 pieces of data: the
parachain validation code, the <a href="types/availability.html"><code>AvailableData</code></a>, and the
<a href="types/candidate.html"><code>CandidateReceipt</code></a>. The validation code is available on-chain, and published ahead of time, so
that no two branches of the relay chain have diverging views of the validation code for a given parachain. Note that
only for the first scenario, where the parablock has been included on a branch of the relay chain, is the data
necessarily available. Thus, dispute processes should begin with an availability process to ensure availability of the
<code>AvailableData</code>. This availability process will conclude quickly if the data is already available. If the data is not
already available, then the initiator of the dispute must make it available.</p>
<p>Disputes have both an on-chain and an off-chain component. Slashing and punishment is handled on-chain, so votes by
validators on either side of the dispute must be placed on-chain. Furthermore, a dispute on one branch of the relay
chain should be transposed to all other active branches of the relay chain. The fact that slashing occurs <em>in all
histories</em> is crucial for deterring attempts to attack the network. The attacker should not be able to escape with their
funds because the network has moved on to another branch of the relay chain where no attack was attempted.</p>
<p>In fact, this is why we introduce a distinction between <em>local</em> and <em>remote</em> disputes. We categorize disputes as either
local or remote relative to any particular branch of the relay chain. Local disputes are about dealing with our first
scenario, where a parablock has been included on the specific branch we are looking at. In these cases, the chain is
corrupted all the way back to the point where the parablock was backed and must be discarded. However, as mentioned
before, the dispute must propagate to all other branches of the relay chain. All other disputes are considered <em>remote</em>.
For the on-chain component, when handling a dispute for a block which was not included in the current fork of the relay
chain, it is impossible to discern between our attack scenarios. It is possible that the parablock was included
somewhere, or backed somewhere, or wasn't backed anywhere. The on-chain component for handling these cases will be the
same.</p>
<h2 id="initiation"><a class="header" href="#initiation">Initiation</a></h2>
<p>Disputes are initiated by any validator who finds their opinion on the validity of a parablock in opposition to another
issued statement. As all statements currently gathered by the relay chain imply validity, disputes will be initiated
only by nodes which perceive that the parablock is bad.</p>
<p>The initiation of a dispute begins off-chain. A validator signs a message indicating that it disputes the validity of
the parablock and notifies all other validators, off-chain, of all of the statements it is aware of for the disputed
parablock. These may be backing statements or approval-checking statements. It is worth noting that there is no special
message type for initiating a dispute. It is the same message as is used to participate in a dispute and vote
negatively. As such, there is no consensus required on who initiated a dispute, only on the fact that there is a dispute
in-progress.</p>
<p>In practice, the initiator of a dispute will be either one of the backers or one of the approval checkers for the
parablock. If the result of execution is found to be invalid, the validator will initiate the dispute as described
above. Furthermore, if the dispute occurs during the backing phase, the initiator must make the data available to other
validators. If the dispute occurs during approval checking, the data is already available.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is possible that for backing disputes, i.e. where the data is not already available among all validators,
that an adversary may DoS the few parties who are checking the block to prevent them from distributing the data to other
validators participating in the dispute process. Note that this can only occur pre-inclusion for any given parablock, so
the downside of this attack is small and it is not security-critical to address these cases. However, we assume that the
adversary can only prevent the validator from issuing messages for a limited amount of time. We also assume that there
is a side-channel where the relay chain's governance mechanisms can trigger disputes by providing the full PoV and
candidate receipt on-chain manually.</p>
<h2 id="dispute-participation"><a class="header" href="#dispute-participation">Dispute Participation</a></h2>
<p>Once becoming aware of a dispute, it is the responsibility of all validators to participate in the dispute. Concretely,
this means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Circulate all statements about the candidate that we are aware of - backing statements, approval checking
statements, and dispute statements.</li>
<li>If we have already issued any type of statement about the candidate, go no further.</li>
<li>Download the <a href="types/availability.html"><code>AvailableData</code></a>. If possible, this should first be attempted from other
dispute participants or backing validators, and then <a href="node/availability/availability-recovery.html">(via
erasure-coding)</a> from all validators.</li>
<li>Extract the Validation Code from any recent relay chain block. Code is guaranteed to be kept available on-chain, so
we don't need to download any particular fork of the chain.</li>
<li>Execute the block under the validation code, using the <code>AvailableData</code>, and check that all outputs are correct,
including the <code>erasure-root</code> of the <a href="types/candidate.html"><code>CandidateReceipt</code></a>.</li>
<li>Issue a dispute participation statement to the effect of the validity of the candidate block.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disputes <em>conclude</em> after ⅔ supermajority is reached in either direction.</p>
<p>The on-chain component of disputes can be initiated by providing any two conflicting votes and it also waits for a ⅔
supermajority on either side. The on-chain component also tracks which parablocks have already been disputed so the same
parablock may only be disputed once on any particular branch of the relay chain. Lastly, it also tracks which blocks
have been included on the current branch of the relay chain. When a dispute is initiated for a para, inclusion is halted
for the para until the dispute concludes.</p>
<p>The author of a relay chain block should initiate the on-chain component of disputes for all disputes which the chain is
not aware of, and provide all statements to the on-chain component as well. This should all be done via <em>inherents</em>.</p>
<p>Validators can learn about dispute statements in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Receiving them from other validators over gossip</li>
<li>Scraping them from imported blocks of the relay chain. This is also used for validators to track other types of
statements, such as backing statements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Validators are rewarded for providing statements to the chain as well as for participating in the dispute, on either
side. However, the losing side of the dispute is slashed.</p>
<h2 id="dispute-conclusion"><a class="header" href="#dispute-conclusion">Dispute Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Disputes, roughly, are over when one side reaches a ⅔ supermajority. They may also never conclude without either side
witnessing supermajority, which will only happen if the majority of validators are unable to vote for some reason.
Furthermore, disputes on-chain will stay open for some fixed amount of time even after concluding, to accept new votes.</p>
<p>Late votes, after the dispute already reached a ⅔ supermajority, must be rewarded (albeit a smaller amount) as well.</p>

<p>The set of validators eligible to vote consists of the validators that had duty at the time of backing, plus backing
votes by the backing validators.</p>
<p>If a validator receives an initial dispute message (a set of votes where there are at least two opposing votes
contained), and the PoV or Code are hence not reconstructable from local storage, that validator must request the
required data from its peers.</p>
<p>The dispute availability message must contain code, persisted validation data, and the proof of validity.</p>
<p>Only peers that already voted shall be queried for the dispute availability data.</p>
<p>The peer to be queried for disputes data, must be picked at random.</p>
<p>A validator must retain code, persisted validation data and PoV until a block, that contains the dispute resolution, is
finalized - plus an additional 24 hours.</p>
<p>Dispute availability gossip must continue beyond the dispute resolution, until the post resolution timeout expired
(equiv to the timeout until which additional late votes are accepted).</p>
<p>Remote disputes are disputes that are in relation to a chain that is not part of the local validators active heads.</p>
<p>All incoming votes must be persisted.</p>
<p>Persisted votes stay persisted for <code>N</code> sessions, and are cleaned up on a per session basis.</p>
<p>Votes must be queryable by a particular validator, identified by its signing key.</p>
<p>Votes must be queryable by a particular validator, identified by a session index and the validator index valid in that
session.</p>
<p>If there exists a negative and a positive vote for a particular block, a dispute is detected.</p>
<p>If a dispute is detected, all currently available votes for that block must be gossiped.</p>
<p>If an incoming dispute vote is detected, a validator must cast their own vote. The vote is determined by validating the
PoV with the Code at the time of backing the block in question.</p>
<p>If the validator was also a backer of the block, validation and casting an additional vote should be skipped.</p>
<p>If the count of votes pro or cons regarding the disputed block, reaches the required ⅔ supermajority (including the
backing votes), the conclusion must be recorded on chain and the voters on the loosing and no-shows being slashed
appropriately.</p>
<p>If a block is found invalid by a dispute resolution, it must be blacklisted to avoid resync or further build on that
chain if other chains are available (to be detailed in the grandpa fork choice rule).</p>
<p>A dispute accepts Votes after the dispute is resolved, for 1 day.</p>
<p>If a vote is received, after the dispute is resolved, the vote shall still be recorded in the state root, albeit
yielding less reward.</p>
<p>Recording in the state root might happen batched, at timeout expiry.</p>
<p>If a new active head/chain appears, and the dispute resolution was not recorded on that chain yet, the dispute
resolution or open dispute must be recorded / transplanted to that chain as well, since the disputes must be present on
all chains to make sure the offender is punished.</p>
<p>If a validator votes in two opposing ways, this composes of a double vote like in other cases (backing, approval
voting).</p>
<p>If a dispute is not resolved within due time, all validators are to be slashed for a small amount.</p>
<p>If a dispute is not resolved within due time, governance mode shall be entered for manual resolution.</p>
<p>If a validator unexpectedly restarts, the dispute shall be continued with the state based on votes being cast and being
present in persistent storage.</p>

<p>Chain selection processes in blockchains are used for the purpose of selecting blocks to build on and finalize. It is
important for these processes to be consistent among nodes and resilient to a maximum proportion of malicious nodes
which do not obey the chain selection process.</p>
<p>The parachain host uses both a block authoring system and a finality gadget. The chain selection strategy of the
parachain host involves two key components: a <em>leaf-selection</em> rule and a set of <em>finality constraints</em>. When it's a
validator's turn to author on a block, they are expected to select the best block via the leaf-selection rule to build
on top of. When a validator is participating in finality, there is a minimum block which can be voted on, which is
usually the finalized block. The validator should select the best chain according to the leaf-selection rule and
subsequently apply the finality constraints to arrive at the actual vote cast by that validator.</p>
<p>Before diving into the particularities of the leaf-selection rule and the finality constraints, it's important to
discuss the goals that these components are meant to achieve. For this it is useful to create the definitions of
<em>viable</em> and <em>finalizable</em> blocks.</p>
<h2 id="property-definitions"><a class="header" href="#property-definitions">Property Definitions</a></h2>
<p>A block is considered <strong>viable</strong> when all of the following hold:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is or descends from the finalized block</li>
<li>It is not <strong>stagnant</strong></li>
<li>It is not <strong>reverted</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>A block is considered a <strong>viable leaf</strong> when all of the following hold:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is <strong>viable</strong></li>
<li>It has no <strong>viable</strong> descendant.</li>
</ol>
<p>A block is considered <strong>stagnant</strong> when either:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is unfinalized, is not approved, and has not been approved within 2 minutes</li>
<li>Its parent is <strong>stagnant</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>A block is considered <strong>reverted</strong> when either:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is unfinalized and includes a candidate which has lost a dispute</li>
<li>Its parent is <strong>reverted</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A block is considered <strong>finalizable</strong> when all of the following hold:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is <strong>viable</strong></li>
<li>Its parent, if unfinalized, is <strong>finalizable</strong>.</li>
<li>It is either finalized or approved.</li>
<li>It is either finalized or includes no candidates which have unresolved disputes or have lost a dispute.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-leaf-selection-rule"><a class="header" href="#the-leaf-selection-rule">The leaf-selection rule</a></h2>
<p>We assume that every block has an implicit weight or score which can be used to compare blocks. In BABE, this is
determined by the number of primary slots included in the chain. In PoW, this is the chain with either the most work or
GHOST weight.</p>
<p>The leaf-selection rule based on our definitions above is simple: we take the maximum-scoring viable leaf we are aware
of. In the case of a tie we select the one with a lower lexicographical block hash.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-chain-containing-rule"><a class="header" href="#the-best-chain-containing-rule">The best-chain-containing rule</a></h2>
<p>Finality gadgets, as mentioned above, will often impose an additional requirement to vote on a chain containing a
specific block, known as the <strong>required</strong> block. Although this is typically the most recently finalized block, it is
possible that it may be a block that is unfinalized. When receiving such a request:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the required block is the best finalized block, then select the best viable leaf.</li>
<li>If the required block is unfinalized and non-viable, then select the required block and go no further. This is likely
an indication that something bad will be finalized in the network, which will never happen when approvals &amp; disputes
are functioning correctly. Nevertheless we account for the case here.</li>
<li>If the required block is unfinalized and viable, then iterate over the viable leaves in descending order by score and
select the first one which contains the required block in its chain. Backwards iteration is a simple way to check
this, but if unfinalized chains grow long then Merkle Mountain-Ranges will most likely be more efficient.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once selecting a leaf, the chain should be constrained to the maximum of the required block or the highest
<strong>finalizable</strong> ancestor.</p>

<p>This section aims to describe, at a high level, the code architecture and subsystems involved in the implementation of
an individual Parachain Host. It also illuminates certain subtleties and challenges faced in the design and
implementation of those subsystems.</p>
<p>To recap, Polkadot includes a blockchain known as the relay-chain. A blockchain is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of
state transitions, where every block can be considered to be the head of a linked-list (known as a &quot;chain&quot; or &quot;fork&quot;)
with a cumulative state which is determined by applying the state transition of each block in turn. All paths through
the DAG terminate at the Genesis Block. In fact, the blockchain is a tree, since each block can have only one parent.</p>

<p>A blockchain network is comprised of nodes. These nodes each have a view of many different forks of a blockchain and
must decide which forks to follow and what actions to take based on the forks of the chain that they are aware of.</p>
<p>So in specifying an architecture to carry out the functionality of a Parachain Host, we have to answer two categories of
questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the state-transition function of the blockchain? What is necessary for a transition to be considered valid,
and what information is carried within the implicit state of a block?</li>
<li>Being aware of various forks of the blockchain as well as global private state such as a view of the current time,
what behaviors should a node undertake? What information should a node extract from the state of which forks, and how
should that information be used?</li>
</ol>
<p>The first category of questions will be addressed by the Runtime, which defines the state-transition logic of the chain.
Runtime logic only has to focus on the perspective of one chain, as each state has only a single parent state.</p>
<p>The second category of questions addressed by Node-side behavior. Node-side behavior defines all activities that a node
undertakes, given its view of the blockchain/block-DAG. Node-side behavior can take into account all or many of the
forks of the blockchain, and only conditionally undertake certain activities based on which forks it is aware of, as
well as the state of the head of those forks.</p>

<p>It is also helpful to divide Node-side behavior into two further categories: Networking and Core. Networking behaviors
relate to how information is distributed between nodes. Core behaviors relate to internal work that a specific node
does. These two categories of behavior often interact, but can be heavily abstracted from each other. Core behaviors
care that information is distributed and received, but not the internal details of how distribution and receipt
function. Networking behaviors act on requests for distribution or fetching of information, but are not concerned with
how the information is used afterwards. This allows us to create clean boundaries between Core and Networking
activities, improving the modularity of the code.</p>

<p>Node-side behavior is split up into various subsystems. Subsystems are long-lived workers that perform a particular
category of work. Subsystems can communicate with each other, and do so via an <a href="node/overseer.html">Overseer</a> that
prevents race conditions.</p>
<p>Runtime logic is divided up into Modules and APIs. Modules encapsulate particular behavior of the system. Modules
consist of storage, routines, and entry-points. Routines are invoked by entry points, by other modules, upon block
initialization or closing. Routines can read and alter the storage of the module. Entry-points are the means by which
new information is introduced to a module and can limit the origins (user, root, parachain) that they accept being
called by. Each block in the blockchain contains a set of Extrinsics. Each extrinsic targets a a specific entry point to
trigger and which data should be passed to it. Runtime APIs provide a means for Node-side behavior to extract meaningful
information from the state of a single fork.</p>
<p>These two aspects of the implementation are heavily dependent on each other. The Runtime depends on Node-side behavior
to author blocks, and to include Extrinsics which trigger the correct entry points. The Node-side behavior relies on
Runtime APIs to extract information necessary to determine which actions to take.</p>

<p>The Polkadot Host has a few mechanisms that are responsible for message passing. They can be generally divided on two
categories: Horizontal and Vertical. Horizontal Message Passing (HMP) refers to mechanisms that are responsible for
exchanging messages between parachains. Vertical Message Passing (VMP) is used for communication between the relay chain
and parachains.</p>

<p>Downward Message Passing (DMP) is a mechanism for delivering messages to parachains from the relay chain.</p>
<p>Each parachain has its own queue that stores all pending inbound downward messages. A parachain doesn't have to process
all messages at once, however, there are rules as to how the downward message queue should be processed. Currently, at
least one message must be consumed per candidate if the queue is not empty. The downward message queue doesn't have a
cap on its size and it is up to the relay-chain to put mechanisms that prevent spamming in place.</p>
<p>Upward Message Passing (UMP) is a mechanism responsible for delivering messages in the opposite direction: from a
parachain up to the relay chain. Upward messages are essentially byte blobs. However, they are interpreted by the
relay-chain according to the XCM standard.</p>
<p>The XCM standard is a common vocabulary of messages. The XCM standard doesn't require a particular interpretation of a
message. However, the parachains host (e.g. Polkadot) guarantees certain semantics for those.</p>
<p>Moreover, while most XCM messages are handled by the on-chain XCM interpreter, some of the messages are special cased.
Specifically, those messages can be checked during the acceptance criteria and thus invalid messages would lead to
rejecting the candidate itself.</p>
<p>One kind of such a message is <code>Xcm::Transact</code>. This upward message can be seen as a way for a parachain to execute
arbitrary entrypoints on the relay-chain. <code>Xcm::Transact</code> messages resemble regular extrinsics with the exception that
they originate from a parachain.</p>
<p>The payload of <code>Xcm::Transact</code> messages is referred as to <code>Dispatchable</code>. When a candidate with such a message is
enacted the dispatchables are put into a queue corresponding to the parachain. There can be only so many dispatchables
in that queue at once. The weight that processing of the dispatchables can consume is limited by a preconfigured value.
Therefore, it is possible that some dispatchables will be left for later blocks. To make the dispatching more fair, the
queues are processed turn-by-turn in a round robin fashion.</p>
<p>The second category of special cased XCM messages are for horizontal messaging channel management, namely messages meant
to request opening and closing HRMP channels (HRMP will be described below).</p>

<p>The most important member of this family is XCMP.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ℹ️ XCMP is currently under construction and details are subject for change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>XCMP is a message passing mechanism between parachains that require minimal involvement of the relay chain. The relay
chain provides means for sending parachains to authenticate messages sent to recipient parachains.</p>
<p>Semantically communication occurs through so called channels. A channel is unidirectional and it has two endpoints, for
sender and for recipient. A channel can be opened only if the both parties agree and closed unilaterally.</p>
<p>Only the channel metadata is stored on the relay-chain in a very compact form: all messages and their contents sent by
the sender parachain are encoded using only one root hash. This root is referred as MQC head.</p>
<p>The authenticity of the messages must be proven using that root hash to the receiving party at the candidate authoring
time. The proof stems from the relay parent storage that contains the root hash of the channel. Since not all messages
are required to be processed by the receiver's candidate, only the processed messages are supplied (i.e. preimages),
rest are provided as hashes.</p>
<p>Further details can be found at the official repository for the <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format/blob/master/README.md">Cross-Consensus Message Format
(XCM)</a>, as well as at the <a href="https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/XCMP.html">W3F research
website</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/web3foundation/polkadots-messaging-scheme-b1ec560908b7">this
blogpost</a>.</p>
<p>HRMP (Horizontally Relay-routed Message Passing) is a stop gap that predates XCMP. Semantically, it mimics XCMP's
interface. The crucial difference from XCMP though is that all the messages are stored in the relay-chain storage. That
makes things simple but at the same time that makes HRMP more demanding in terms of resources thus making it more
expensive.</p>
<p>Once XCMP is available we expect to retire HRMP.</p>

<h2 id="motivation"><a class="header" href="#motivation">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>Parachains' validation function is described by a wasm module that we refer to as a PVF. Since a PVF is a wasm module
the typical way of executing it is to compile it to machine code.</p>
<p>Typically an optimizing compiler consists of algorithms that are able to optimize the resulting machine code heavily.
However, while those algorithms perform quite well for a typical wasm code produced by standard toolchains (e.g.
rustc/LLVM), those algorithms can be abused to consume a lot of resources. Moreover, since those algorithms are rather
complex there is a lot of room for a bug that can crash the compiler.</p>
<p>If compilation of a Parachain Validation Function (PVF) takes too long or uses too much memory, this can leave a node in
limbo as to whether a candidate of that parachain is valid or not.</p>
<p>The amount of time that a PVF takes to compile is a subjective resource limit and as such PVFs may be maliciously
crafted so that there is e.g. a 50/50 split of validators which can and cannot compile and execute the PVF.</p>
<p>This has the following implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>In backing, inclusion may be slow due to backing groups being unable to execute the block</li>
<li>In approval checking, there may be many no-shows, leading to slow finality</li>
<li>In disputes, neither side may reach supermajority. Nobody will get slashed and the chain will not be reverted or
finalized.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of this issue we need a fairly hard guarantee that the PVFs of registered parachains/threads can be compiled
within a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<h2 id="solution"><a class="header" href="#solution">Solution</a></h2>
<p>The problem is solved by having a pre-checking process.</p>
<h3 id="pre-checking"><a class="header" href="#pre-checking">Pre-checking</a></h3>
<p>Pre-checking mostly consists of attempting to prepare (compile) the PVF WASM blob. We use more strict limits (e.g.
timeouts) here compared to regular preparation for execution. This way errors during preparation later are likely
unrelated to the PVF itself, as it already passed pre-checking. We can treat such errors as local node issues.</p>
<p>We also have an additional step where we attempt to instantiate the WASM runtime without running it. This is unrelated
to preparation so we don't time it, but it does help us catch more issues.</p>
<h3 id="protocol"><a class="header" href="#protocol">Protocol</a></h3>
<p>Pre-checking is run when a new validation code is included in the chain. A new PVF can be added in two cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new parachain is registered.</li>
<li>An existing parachain signalled an upgrade of its validation code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before any of those operations finish, the PVF pre-checking vote is initiated. The PVF pre-checking vote is identified
by the PVF code hash that is being voted on. If there is already PVF pre-checking process running, then no new PVF
pre-checking vote will be started. Instead, the operation just subscribes to the existing vote.</p>
<p>The pre-checking vote can be concluded either by obtaining a threshold of votes for a decision, or if it expires. The
threshold to accept is a supermajority of 2/3 of validators. We reject once a supermajority is no longer possible.</p>
<p>Each validator checks the list of PVFs available for voting. The vote is binary, i.e. accept or reject a given PVF. As
soon as the threshold of votes are collected for one of the sides of the vote, the voting is concluded in that direction
and the effects of the voting are enacted.</p>
<p>Only validators from the active set can participate in the vote. The set of active validators can change each session.
That's why we reset the votes each session. A voting that observed a certain number of sessions will be rejected.</p>
<p>The effects of the PVF accepting depend on the operations requested it:</p>
<ol>
<li>All onboardings subscribed to the approved PVF pre-checking process will get scheduled and after passing 2 session
boundaries they will be onboarded.</li>
<li>All upgrades subscribed to the approved PVF pre-checking process will get scheduled very similarly to the existing
process. Upgrades with pre-checking are really the same process that is just delayed by the time required for
pre-checking voting. In case of instant approval the mechanism is exactly the same.</li>
</ol>
<p>In case PVF pre-checking process was concluded with rejection, then all the operations that are subscribed to the
rejected PVF pre-checking process will be processed as follows. That is, onboarding or upgrading will be cancelled.</p>
<p>The logic described above is implemented by the <a href="runtime/paras.html">paras</a> module.</p>
<h3 id="subsystem"><a class="header" href="#subsystem">Subsystem</a></h3>
<p>On the node-side, there is a PVF pre-checking <a href="node/utility/pvf-prechecker.html">subsystem</a> that scans the chain for new PVFs
via using <a href="runtime-api/pvf-prechecking.html">runtime APIs</a>. Upon finding a new PVF, the subsystem will initiate a PVF pre-checking
request and wait for the result. Whenever the result is obtained, the subsystem will use the <a href="runtime-api/pvf-prechecking.html">runtime
API</a> to submit a vote for the PVF. The vote is an unsigned transaction. The vote will be distributed
via the gossip similarly to a normal transaction. Eventually a block producer will include the vote into the block where
it will be handled by the <a href="runtime/paras.html">runtime</a>.</p>
<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Parachains' validation function is described by a wasm module that we refer to as a PVF.</p>
<p>In order to make the PVF usable for candidate validation it has to be registered on-chain.</p>
<p>As part of the registration process, it has to go through pre-checking. Pre-checking is a game of attempting preparation
and additional checks, and reporting the results back on-chain.</p>
<p>We define preparation as a process that: validates the consistency of the wasm binary (aka prevalidation) and the
compilation of the wasm module into machine code (referred to as an artifact).</p>
<p>Besides pre-checking, preparation can also be triggered by execution, since a compiled artifact is needed for the
execution. If an artifact already exists, execution will skip preparation. If it does do preparation, execution uses a
more lenient timeout than preparation, to avoid the situation where honest validators fail on valid, pre-checked PVFs.</p>
<footer id="last-change">Last change: 2023-09-04, commit: <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/commit/a30092ab42">a30092ab42</a></footer><div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="runtime-architecture"><a class="header" href="#runtime-architecture">Runtime Architecture</a></h1>
<p>It's clear that we want to separate different aspects of the runtime logic into different modules. Modules define their
own storage, routines, and entry-points. They also define initialization and finalization logic.</p>
<p>Due to the (lack of) guarantees provided by a particular blockchain-runtime framework, there is no defined or dependable
order in which modules' initialization or finalization logic will run. Supporting this blockchain-runtime framework is
important enough to include that same uncertainty in our model of runtime modules in this guide. Furthermore,
initialization logic of modules can trigger the entry-points or routines of other modules. This is one architectural
pressure against dividing the runtime logic into multiple modules. However, in this case the benefits of splitting
things up outweigh the costs, provided that we take certain precautions against initialization and entry-point races.</p>
<p>We also expect, although it's beyond the scope of this guide, that these runtime modules will exist alongside various
other modules. This has two facets to consider. First, even if the modules that we describe here don't invoke each
others' entry points or routines during initialization, we still have to protect against those other modules doing that.
Second, some of those modules are expected to provide governance capabilities for the chain. Configuration exposed by
parachain-host modules is mostly for the benefit of these governance modules, to allow the operators or community of the
chain to tweak parameters.</p>
<p>The runtime's primary role is to manage scheduling and updating of parachains, as well as handling misbehavior reports
and slashing. This guide doesn't focus on how parachains are registered, only that they are. Also, this runtime
description assumes that validator sets are selected somehow, but doesn't assume any other details than a periodic
<em>session change</em> event. Session changes give information about the incoming validator set and the validator set of the
following session.</p>
<p>The runtime also serves another role, which is to make data available to the Node-side logic via Runtime APIs. These
Runtime APIs should be sufficient for the Node-side code to author blocks correctly.</p>
<p>There is some functionality of the relay chain relating to parachains that we also consider beyond the scope of this
document. In particular, all modules related to how parachains are registered aren't part of this guide, although we do
provide routines that should be called by the registration process.</p>
<p>We will split the logic of the runtime up into these modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initializer: manages initialization order of the other modules.</li>
<li>Shared: manages shared storage and configurations for other modules.</li>
<li>Configuration: manages configuration and configuration updates in a non-racy manner.</li>
<li>Paras: manages chain-head and validation code for parachains.</li>
<li>Scheduler: manages parachain scheduling as well as validator assignments.</li>
<li>Inclusion: handles the inclusion and availability of scheduled parachains.</li>
<li>SessionInfo: manages various session keys of validators and other params stored per session.</li>
<li>Disputes: handles dispute resolution for included, available parablocks.</li>
<li>Slashing: handles slashing logic for concluded disputes.</li>
<li>HRMP: handles horizontal messages between paras.</li>
<li>UMP: handles upward messages from a para to the relay chain.</li>
<li>DMP: handles downward messages from the relay chain to the para.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="runtime/initializer.html">Initializer module</a> is special - it's responsible for handling the initialization logic of the
other modules to ensure that the correct initialization order and related invariants are maintained. The other modules
won't specify a on-initialize logic, but will instead expose a special semi-private routine that the initialization
module will call. The other modules are relatively straightforward and perform the roles described above.</p>
<p>The Parachain Host operates under a changing set of validators. Time is split up into periodic sessions, where each
session brings a potentially new set of validators. Sessions are buffered by one, meaning that the validators of the
upcoming session <code>n+1</code> are determined at the end of session <code>n-1</code>, right before session <code>n</code> starts. Parachain Host
runtime modules need to react to changes in the validator set, as it will affect the runtime logic for processing
candidate backing, availability bitfields, and misbehavior reports. The Parachain Host modules can't determine
ahead-of-time exactly when session change notifications are going to happen within the block (note: this depends on
module initialization order again - better to put session before parachains modules).</p>
<p>The relay chain is intended to use BABE or SASSAFRAS, which both have the property that a session changing at a block is
determined not by the number of the block but instead by the time the block is authored. In some sense, sessions change
in-between blocks, not at blocks. This has the side effect that the session of a child block cannot be determined solely
by the parent block's identifier. Being able to unilaterally determine the validator-set at a specific block based on
its parent hash would make a lot of Node-side logic much simpler.</p>
<p>In order to regain the property that the validator set of a block is predictable by its parent block, we delay session
changes' application to Parachains by 1 block. This means that if there is a session change at block X, that session
change will be stored and applied during initialization of direct descendants of X. This principal side effect of this
change is that the Parachains runtime can disagree with session or consensus modules about which session it currently
is. Misbehavior reporting routines in particular will be affected by this, although not severely. The parachains runtime
might believe it is the last block of the session while the system is really in the first block of the next session. In
such cases, a historical validator-set membership proof will need to accompany any misbehavior report, although they
typically do not need to during current-session misbehavior reports.</p>
<p>So the other role of the initializer module is to forward session change notifications to modules in the initialization
order. Session change is also the point at which the <a href="runtime/configuration.html">Configuration Module</a> updates the configuration.
Most of the other modules will handle changes in the configuration during their session change operation, so the
initializer should provide both the old and new configuration to all the other modules alongside the session change
notification. This means that a session change notification should consist of the following data:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct SessionChangeNotification {
 // The new validators in the session.
 validators: Vec&lt;ValidatorId&gt;,
 // The validators for the next session.
 queued: Vec&lt;ValidatorId&gt;,
 // The configuration before handling the session change.
 prev_config: HostConfiguration,
 // The configuration after handling the session change.
 new_config: HostConfiguration,
 // A secure randomn seed for the session, gathered from BABE.
 random_seed: [u8; 32],
 // The session index of the beginning session.
 session_index: SessionIndex,
}
<span class="boring">}

<p>Before initializing modules, remove all changes from the <code>BufferedSessionChanges</code> with number less than or equal to the

<p>The <a href="runtime/configuration.html">Configuration Module</a> is first, since all other modules need to operate under the same

<p>This module is responsible for managing all configuration of the parachain host in-flight. It provides a central point
for configuration updates to prevent races between configuration changes and parachain-processing logic. Configuration
can only change during the session change routine, and as this module handles the session change notification first it
provides an invariant that the configuration does not change throughout the entire session. Both the
<a href="runtime/scheduler.html">scheduler</a> and <a href="runtime/inclusion.html">inclusion</a> modules rely on this invariant to ensure proper behavior of the
scheduler.</p>
<p>The configuration that we will be tracking is the <a href="runtime/../types/runtime.html#host-configuration"><code>HostConfiguration</code></a> struct.</p>

<p>The Shared Module currently has no initialization routines.</p>
<p>The Shared Module is initialized directly after the Configuration module, but before all other modules. It is important
to update the Shared Module before any other module since its state may be used within the logic of other modules, and
it is important that the state is consistent across them.</p>
<h2 id="session-change-2"><a class="header" href="#session-change-2">Session Change</a></h2>
<p>During a session change, the Shared Module receives and stores the current Session Index directly from the initializer
module, along with the broader validator set, and it returns the new list of validators.</p>
<p>The list of validators should be first shuffled according to the chain's random seed and then truncated. The indices of
these validators should be set to <code>ActiveValidatorIndices</code> and then returned back to the initializer.
<code>ActiveValidatorKeys</code> should be set accordingly.</p>
<p>This information is used in the:</p>

<p>After a backed candidate is made available, it is included and proceeds into an acceptance period during which
validators are randomly selected to do (secondary) approval checks of the parablock. Any reports disputing the validity
of the candidate will cause escalation, where even more validators are requested to check the block, and so on, until
either the parablock is determined to be invalid or valid. Those on the wrong side of the dispute are slashed and, if
the parablock is deemed invalid, the relay chain is rolled back to a point before that block was included.</p>
<p>However, this isn't the end of the story. We are working in a forkful blockchain environment, which carries three
important considerations:</p>
<ol>
<li>For security, validators that misbehave shouldn't only be slashed on one fork, but on all possible forks. Validators
that misbehave shouldn't be able to create a new fork of the chain when caught and get away with their misbehavior.</li>
<li>It is possible (and likely) that the parablock being contested has not appeared on all forks.</li>
<li>If a block author believes that there is a disputed parablock on a specific fork that will resolve to a reversion of
the fork, that block author has more incentive to build on a different fork which does not include that parablock.</li>
</ol>
<p>This means that in all likelihood, there is the possibility of disputes that are started on one fork of the relay chain,
and as soon as the dispute resolution process starts to indicate that the parablock is indeed invalid, that fork of the
relay chain will be abandoned and the dispute will never be fully resolved on that chain.</p>
<p>Even if this doesn't happen, there is the possibility that there are two disputes underway, and one resolves leading to
a reversion of the chain before the other has concluded. In this case we want to both transplant the concluded dispute
onto other forks of the chain as well as the unconcluded dispute.</p>
<p>We account for these requirements by having the disputes module handle two kinds of disputes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Local disputes: those contesting the validity of the current fork by disputing a parablock included within it.</li>
<li>Remote disputes: a dispute that has partially or fully resolved on another fork which is transplanted to the local
fork for completion and eventual slashing.</li>
</ol>
<p>When a local dispute concludes negatively, the chain needs to be abandoned and reverted back to a block where the state
does not contain the bad parablock. We expect that due to the <a href="runtime/../protocol-approval.html">Approval Checking Protocol</a>, the
current executing block should not be finalized. So we do two things when a local dispute concludes negatively:</p>
<ol>
<li>Freeze the state of parachains so nothing further is backed or included.</li>
<li>Issue a digest in the header of the block that signals to nodes that this branch of the chain is to be abandoned.</li>
</ol>
<p>If, as is expected, the chain is unfinalized, the freeze will have no effect as no honest validator will attempt to
build on the frozen chain. However, if the approval checking protocol has failed and the bad parablock is finalized, the
freeze serves to put the chain into a governance-only mode.</p>
<p>The storage of this module is designed around tracking <a href="runtime/../types/disputes.html#disputestate"><code>DisputeState</code>s</a>, updating
them with votes, and tracking blocks included by this branch of the relay chain. It also contains a <code>Frozen</code> parameter
designed to freeze the state of all parachains.</p>

<h1 id="disputes-filtering"><a class="header" href="#disputes-filtering">Disputes filtering</a></h1>
<p>All disputes delivered to the runtime by the client are filtered before the actual import. In this context actual import
means persisted in the runtime storage. The filtering has got two purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limit the amount of data saved onchain.</li>
<li>Prevent persisting malicious dispute data onchain.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Implementation note</em>: Filtering is performed in function <code>filter_dispute_data</code> from <code>Disputes</code> pallet.</p>
<p>The filtering is performed on the whole statement set which is about to be imported onchain. The following filters are
applied:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove ancient disputes - if a dispute is concluded before the block number indicated in <code>OLDEST_ACCEPTED</code> parameter
it is removed from the set. <code>OLDEST_ACCEPTED</code> is a runtime configuration option. <em>Implementation note</em>:
<code>dispute_post_conclusion_acceptance_period</code> from <code>HostConfiguration</code> is used in the current Polkadot/Kusama
implementation.</li>
<li>Remove votes from unknown validators. If there is a vote from a validator which wasn't an authority in the session
where the dispute was raised - they are removed. Please note that this step removes only single votes instead of
removing the whole dispute.</li>
<li>Remove one sided disputes - if a dispute doesn't contain two opposing votes it is not imported onchain. This serves
as a measure not to import one sided disputes. A dispute is raised only if there are two opposing votes so if the
client is not sending them the dispute is a potential spam.</li>
<li>Remove unconfirmed disputes - if a dispute contains less votes than the byzantine threshold it is removed. This is
also a spam precaution. A legitimate client will send only confirmed disputes to the runtime.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="rewards-and-slashing"><a class="header" href="#rewards-and-slashing">Rewards and slashing</a></h1>
<p>After the disputes are filtered the validators participating in the disputes are rewarded and more importantly the
offenders are slashed. Generally there can be two types of punishments:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;against valid&quot; - the offender claimed that a valid candidate is invalid.</li>
<li>&quot;for invalid&quot; - the offender claimed that an invalid candidate is valid.</li>
</ul>
<p>A dispute might be inconclusive. This means that it has timed out without being confirmed. A confirmed dispute is one
containing votes more than the byzantine threshold (1/3 of the active validators). Validators participating in
inconclusive disputes are not slashed. Thanks to the applied filtering (described in the previous section) one can be
confident that there are no spam disputes in the runtime. So if a validator is not voting it is due to another reason
(e.g. being under DoS attack). There is no reason to punish such validators with a slash.</p>
<p><em>Implementation note</em>: Slashing is performed in <code>process_checked_dispute_data</code> from <code>Disputes</code> pallet.</p>

<p>Note that if PVF pre-checking is enabled, onboarding of a para may potentially be delayed. This can happen due to PVF
pre-checking voting concluding late.</p>
<p>During the transition period, the para object is still considered in its existing state.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TODO: this section is still heavily under construction. key questions about availability cores and validator
assignment are still open and the flow of the the section may be contradictory or inconsistent</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Scheduler module is responsible for two main tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Partitioning validators into groups and assigning groups to parachains.</li>
<li>Scheduling parachains for each block</li>
</ul>
<p>It aims to achieve these tasks with these goals in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be possible to know at least a block ahead-of-time, ideally more, which validators are going to be assigned
to which parachains.</li>
<li>Parachains that have a candidate pending availability in this fork of the chain should not be assigned.</li>
<li>Validator assignments should not be gameable. Malicious cartels should not be able to manipulate the scheduler to
assign themselves as desired.</li>
<li>High or close to optimal throughput of parachains. Work among validator groups should be balanced.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="availability-cores"><a class="header" href="#availability-cores">Availability Cores</a></h2>
<p>The Scheduler manages resource allocation using the concept of &quot;Availability Cores&quot;. There will be one availability core
for each lease holding parachain, and a fixed number of cores used for multiplexing on-demand parachains. Validators
will be partitioned into groups, with the same number of groups as availability cores. Validator groups will be assigned
to different availability cores over time.</p>
<p>An availability core can exist in either one of two states at the beginning or end of a block: free or occupied. A free
availability core can have a lease holding or on-demand parachain assigned to it for the potential to have a backed
candidate included. After backing, the core enters the occupied state as the backed candidate is pending availability.
There is an important distinction: a core is not considered occupied until it is in charge of a block pending
availability, although the implementation may treat scheduled cores the same as occupied ones for brevity. A core exits
the occupied state when the candidate is no longer pending availability - either on timeout or on availability. A core
starting in the occupied state can move to the free state and back to occupied all within a single block, as
availability bitfields are processed before backed candidates. At the end of the block, there is a possible timeout on
availability which can move the core back to the free state if occupied.</p>
<p>Cores are treated as an ordered list and are typically referred to by their index in that list.</p>

<h2 id="validator-groups"><a class="header" href="#validator-groups">Validator Groups</a></h2>
<p>Validator group assignments do not need to change very quickly. The security benefits of fast rotation are redundant
with the challenge mechanism in the <a href="runtime/../protocol-approval.html">Approval process</a>. Because of this, we only divide
validators into groups at the beginning of the session and do not shuffle membership during the session. However, we do
take steps to ensure that no particular validator group has dominance over a single lease holding parachain or on-demand
parachain-multiplexer for an entire session to provide better guarantees of live-ness.</p>
<p>Validator groups rotate across availability cores in a round-robin fashion, with rotation occurring at fixed intervals.
The i'th group will be assigned to the <code>(i+k)%n</code>'th core at any point in time, where <code>k</code> is the number of rotations that
have occurred in the session, and <code>n</code> is the number of cores. This makes upcoming rotations within the same session
predictable.</p>
<p>When a rotation occurs, validator groups are still responsible for distributing availability chunks for any previous
cores that are still occupied and pending availability. In practice, rotation and availability-timeout frequencies
should be set so this will only be the core they have just been rotated from. It is possible that a validator group is
rotated onto a core which is currently occupied. In this case, the validator group will have nothing to do until the
previously-assigned group finishes their availability work and frees the core or the availability process times out.
Depending on if the core is for a lease holding parachain or on-demand parachain, a different timeout <code>t</code> from the
<a href="runtime/../types/runtime.html#host-configuration"><code>HostConfiguration</code></a> will apply. Availability timeouts should only be triggered
in the first <code>t-1</code> blocks after the beginning of a rotation.</p>
<h2 id="claims"><a class="header" href="#claims">Claims</a></h2>
<p>On-demand parachains operate on a system of claims. Collators purchase claims on authoring the next block of an
on-demand parachain, although the purchase mechanism is beyond the scope of the scheduler. The scheduler guarantees that
they'll be given at least a certain number of attempts to author a candidate that is backed. Attempts that fail during
the availability phase are not counted, since ensuring availability at that stage is the responsibility of the backing
validators, not of the collator. When a claim is accepted, it is placed into a queue of claims, and each claim is
assigned to a particular on-demand parachain-multiplexing core in advance. Given that the current assignments of
validator groups to cores are known, and the upcoming assignments are predictable, it is possible for on-demand
parachain collators to know who they should be talking to now and how they should begin establishing connections with as
a fallback.</p>
<p>With this information, the Node-side can be aware of which on-demand parachains have a good chance of being includable
within the relay-chain block and can focus any additional resources on backing candidates from those on-demand
parachains. Furthermore, Node-side code is aware of which validator group will be responsible for that thread. If the
necessary conditions are reached for core reassignment, those candidates can be backed within the same block as the core
being freed.</p>
<p>On-demand claims, when scheduled onto a free core, may not result in a block pending availability. This may be due to
collator error, networking timeout, or censorship by the validator group. In this case, the claims should be retried a
certain number of times to give the collator a fair shot.</p>

<h2 id="session-change-5"><a class="header" href="#session-change-5">Session Change</a></h2>
<p>Session changes are the only time that configuration can change, and the <a href="runtime/configuration.html">Configuration module</a>'s
session-change logic is handled before this module's. We also lean on the behavior of the <a href="runtime/inclusion.html">Inclusion
module</a> which clears all its occupied cores on session change. Thus we don't have to worry about cores
being occupied across session boundaries and it is safe to re-size the <code>AvailabilityCores</code> bitfield.</p>
<p>Actions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set <code>SessionStartBlock</code> to current block number + 1, as session changes are applied at the end of the block.</li>
<li>Clear all <code>Some</code> members of <code>AvailabilityCores</code>. Return all parathread claims to queue with retries un-incremented.</li>
<li>Set <code>configuration = Configuration::configuration()</code> (see
<a href="runtime/../types/runtime.html#host-configuration"><code>HostConfiguration</code></a>)</li>
<li>Fetch <code>Shared::ActiveValidators</code> as AV.</li>
<li>Determine the number of cores &amp; validator groups as <code>n_cores</code>. This is the maximum of
<ol>
<li><code>Paras::parachains().len() + configuration.parathread_cores</code></li>
<li><code>n_validators / max_validators_per_core</code> if <code>configuration.max_validators_per_core</code> is <code>Some</code> and non-zero.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Resize <code>AvailabilityCores</code> to have length <code>n_cores</code> with all <code>None</code> entries.</li>
<li>Compute new validator groups by shuffling using a secure randomness beacon
<ul>
<li>Note that the total number of validators <code>V</code> in AV may not be evenly divided by <code>n_cores</code>.</li>
<li>The groups are selected by partitioning AV.  The first <code>V % N</code> groups will have <code>(V / n_cores) + 1</code> members, while
the remaining groups will have <code>(V / N)</code> members each.</li>
<li>Instead of using the indices within AV, which point to the broader set, indices <em>into</em> AV should be used. This
implies that groups should have simply ascending validator indices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prune the parathread (on-demand parachain) queue to remove all retries beyond <code>configuration.parathread_retries</code>.
<ul>
<li>Also prune all on-demand claims corresponding to de-registered parachains.</li>
<li>all pruned claims should have their entry removed from the parathread (on-demand parachain) index.</li>
<li>assign all non-pruned claims to new cores if the number of on-demand parachain cores has changed between the
<code>new_config</code> and <code>old_config</code> of the <code>SessionChangeNotification</code>.</li>
<li>Assign claims in equal balance across all cores if rebalancing, and set the <code>next_core</code> of the <code>ParathreadQueue</code>
(on-demand queue) by incrementing the relative index of the last assigned core and taking it modulo the number of
on-demand cores.</li>

<ul>
<li>All freed lease holding parachain cores should be assigned to their respective parachain</li>
<li>All freed on-demand parachain cores whose reason for freeing was <code>FreedReason::Concluded</code> should have the claim

<li>Invoke <code>free_cores(freed_cores)</code></li>
<li>The i'th validator group will be assigned to the <code>(i+k)%n</code>'th core at any point in time, where <code>k</code> is the number of

index is valid for this session.</li>
<li><code>availability_timeout_predicate() -&gt; Option&lt;impl Fn(CoreIndex, BlockNumber) -&gt; bool&gt;</code>: returns an optional predicate
that should be used for timing out occupied cores. if <code>None</code>, no timing-out should be done. The predicate accepts the
index of the core, and the block number since which it has been occupied. The predicate should be implemented based on
the time since the last validator group rotation, and the respective parachain timeouts, i.e. only within
<code>max(config.chain_availability_period, config.thread_availability_period)</code> of the last rotation would this return
<code>Some</code>.</li>

<li><code>next_up_on_available(CoreIndex) -&gt; Option&lt;ScheduledCore&gt;</code>: Return the next thing that will be scheduled on this core
assuming it is currently occupied and the candidate occupying it became available. Returns in <code>ScheduledCore</code> format
(todo: link to Runtime APIs page; linkcheck doesn't allow this right now). For lease holding parachains, this is
always the ID of the parachain and no specified collator. For on-demand parachains, this is based on the next item in
the <code>ParathreadQueue</code> (on-demand queue) assigned to that core, and is <code>None</code> if there isn't one.</li>
<li><code>next_up_on_time_out(CoreIndex) -&gt; Option&lt;ScheduledCore&gt;</code>: Return the next thing that will be scheduled on this core
assuming it is currently occupied and the candidate occupying it timed out. Returns in <code>ScheduledCore</code> format (todo:
link to Runtime APIs page; linkcheck doesn't allow this right now). For parachains, this is always the ID of the
parachain and no specified collator. For on-demand parachains, this is based on the next item in the <code>ParathreadQueue</code>

<p>This module is responsible for providing all data given to the runtime by the block author to the various parachains
modules. The entry-point is mandatory, in that it must be invoked exactly once within every block, and it is also
&quot;inherent&quot;, in that it is provided with no origin by the block author. The data within it carries its own
authentication; i.e. the data takes the form of signed statements by validators. Invalid data will be filtered and not
applied.</p>
<p>This module does not have the same initialization/finalization concerns as the others, as it only requires that entry
points be triggered after all modules have initialized and that finalization happens after entry points are triggered.
Both of these are assumptions we have already made about the runtime's order of operations, so this module doesn't need
to be initialized or finalized by the <code>Initializer</code>.</p>
<p>There are a couple of important notes to the operations in this inherent as they relate to disputes.</p>
<ol>
<li>We don't accept bitfields or backed candidates if in &quot;governance-only&quot; mode from having a local dispute conclude on
this fork.</li>
<li>When disputes are initiated, we remove the block from pending availability. This allows us to roll back chains to the
block before blocks are included as opposed to backing. It's important to do this before processing bitfields.</li>
<li><code>Inclusion::collect_disputed</code> is kind of expensive so it's important to gate this on whether there are actually any
new disputes. Which should be never.</li>
<li>And we don't accept parablocks that have open disputes or disputes that have concluded against the candidate. It's
important to import dispute statements before backing, but this is already the case as disputes are imported before
processing bitfields.</li>

<ul>
<li><code>enter</code>: This entry-point accepts one parameter: <a href="runtime/../types/runtime.html#ParaInherentData"><code>ParaInherentData</code></a>.</li>
<li><code>create_inherent</code>: This entry-point accepts one parameter: <code>InherentData</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both entry points share mostly the same code. <code>create_inherent</code> will meaningfully limit inherent data to adhere to the
weight limit, in addition to sanitizing any inputs and filtering out invalid data. Conceptually it is part of the block
production. The <code>enter</code> call on the other hand is part of block import and consumes/imports the data previously produced
by <code>create_inherent</code>.</p>
<p>In practice both calls process inherent data and apply it to the state. Block production and block import should arrive
at the same new state. Hence we re-use the same logic to ensure this is the case.</p>
<p>The only real difference between the two is, that on <code>create_inherent</code> we actually need the processed and filtered
inherent data to build the block, while on <code>enter</code> the processed data should for one be identical to the incoming
inherent data (assuming honest block producers) and second it is irrelevant, as we are not building a block but just
processing it, so the processed inherent data is simply dropped.</p>
<p>This also means that the <code>enter</code> function keeps data around for no good reason. This seems acceptable though as the size
of a block is rather limited. Nevertheless if we ever wanted to optimize this we can easily implement an inherent
collector that has two implementations, where one clones and stores the data and the other just passes it on.</p>

<p>Runtime APIs are the means by which the node-side code extracts information from the state of the runtime.</p>
<p>Every block in the relay-chain contains a <em>state root</em> which is the root hash of a state trie encapsulating all storage
of runtime modules after execution of the block. This is a cryptographic commitment to a unique state. We use the
terminology of accessing the <em>state at</em> a block to refer accessing the state referred to by the state root of that
block.</p>
<p>Although Runtime APIs are often used for simple storage access, they are actually empowered to do arbitrary computation.
The implementation of the Runtime APIs lives within the Runtime as Wasm code and exposes <code>extern</code> functions that can be
invoked with arguments and have a return value. Runtime APIs have access to a variety of host functions, which are
contextual functions provided by the Wasm execution context, that allow it to carry out many different types of
behaviors.</p>
<p>Abilities provided by host functions includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>State Access</li>
<li>Offchain-DB Access</li>
<li>Submitting transactions to the transaction queue</li>
<li>Optimized versions of cryptographic functions</li>
<li>More</li>
</ul>
<p>So it is clear that Runtime APIs are a versatile and powerful tool to leverage the state of the chain. In general, we
will use Runtime APIs for these purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access of a storage item</li>
<li>Access of a bundle of related storage items</li>
<li>Deriving a value from storage based on arguments</li>
<li>Submitting misbehavior reports</li>
</ul>
<p>More broadly, we have the goal of using Runtime APIs to write Node-side code that fulfills the requirements set by the
Runtime. In particular, the constraints set forth by the <a href="runtime-api/../runtime/scheduler.html">Scheduler</a> and
<a href="runtime-api/../runtime/inclusion.html">Inclusion</a> modules. These modules are responsible for advancing paras with a two-phase
protocol where validators are first chosen to validate and back a candidate and then required to ensure availability of
referenced data. In the second phase, validators are meant to attest to those para-candidates that they have their
availability chunk for. As the Node-side code needs to generate the inputs into these two phases, the runtime API needs
to transmit information from the runtime that is aware of the Availability Cores model instantiated by the Scheduler and
Inclusion modules.</p>
<p>Node-side code is also responsible for detecting and reporting misbehavior performed by other validators, and the set of
Runtime APIs needs to provide methods for observing live disputes and submitting reports as transactions.</p>
<p>The next sections will contain information on specific runtime APIs. The format is this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>/// Fetch the value of the runtime API at the block.
///
/// Definitionally, the `at` parameter cannot be any block that is not in the chain.
/// Thus the return value is unconditional. However, for in-practice implementations
/// it may be possible to provide an `at` parameter as a hash, which may not refer to a
/// valid block or one which implements the runtime API. In those cases it would be
/// best for the implementation to return an error indicating the failure mode.
fn some_runtime_api(at: Block, arg1: Type1, arg2: Type2, ...) -&gt; ReturnValue;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Certain runtime APIs concerning the state of a para require the caller to provide an <code>OccupiedCoreAssumption</code>. This
indicates how the result of the runtime API should be computed if there is a candidate from the para occupying an
availability core in the <a href="runtime-api/../runtime/inclusion.html">Inclusion Module</a>.</p>
<p>The choices of assumption are whether the candidate occupying that core should be assumed to have been made available
and included or timed out and discarded, along with a third option to assert that the core was not occupied. This choice
affects everything from the parent head-data, the validation code, and the state of message-queues. Typically, users
will take the assumption that either the core was free or that the occupying candidate was included, as timeouts are
expected only in adversarial circumstances and even so, only in a small minority of blocks directly following validator
set rotations.</p>

<p>Yields information on all availability cores. Cores are either free or occupied. Free cores can have paras assigned to
them. Occupied cores don't, but they can become available part-way through a block due to bitfields and then have
something scheduled on them. To allow optimistic validation of candidates, the occupied cores are accompanied by
information on what is upcoming. This information can be leveraged when validators perceive that there is a high
likelihood of a core becoming available based on bitfields seen, and then optimistically validate something that would
become scheduled based on that, although there is no guarantee on what the block producer will actually include in the
block.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ This runtime API was added in v2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two main runtime APIs to work with PVF pre-checking.</p>
<p>The first runtime API is designed to fetch all PVFs that require pre-checking voting. The PVFs are identified by their
code hashes. As soon as the PVF gains required support, the runtime API will not return the PVF anymore.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn pvfs_require_precheck() -&gt; Vec&lt;ValidationCodeHash&gt;;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The second runtime API is needed to submit the judgement for a PVF, whether it is approved or not. The voting process
uses unsigned transactions. The <a href="runtime-api/../types/pvf-prechecking.html"><code>PvfCheckStatement</code></a> is circulated through the network via
gossip similar to a normal transaction. At some point the validator will include the statement in the block, where it
will be processed by the runtime. If that was the last vote before gaining the super-majority, this PVF will not be
returned by <code>pvfs_require_precheck</code> anymore.</p>

<h2 id="design-goals"><a class="header" href="#design-goals">Design Goals</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Modularity: Components of the system should be as self-contained as possible. Communication boundaries between
components should be well-defined and mockable. This is key to creating testable, easily reviewable code.</li>
<li>Minimizing side effects: Components of the system should aim to minimize side effects and to communicate with other
components via message-passing.</li>
<li>Operational Safety: The software will be managing signing keys where conflicting messages can lead to large amounts of
value to be slashed. Care should be taken to ensure that no messages are signed incorrectly or in conflict with each
other.</li>
</ul>
<p>The architecture of the node-side behavior aims to embody the Rust principles of ownership and message-passing to create
clean, isolatable code. Each resource should have a single owner, with minimal sharing where unavoidable.</p>
<p>Many operations that need to be carried out involve the network, which is asynchronous. This asynchrony affects all core
subsystems that rely on the network as well. The approach of hierarchical state machines is well-suited to this kind of
environment.</p>
<p>We introduce</p>
<h2 id="components"><a class="header" href="#components">Components</a></h2>
<p>The node architecture consists of the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Overseer (and subsystems): A hierarchy of state machines where an overseer supervises subsystems. Subsystems can
contain their own internal hierarchy of jobs. This is elaborated on in the next section on Subsystems.</li>
<li>A block proposer: Logic triggered by the consensus algorithm of the chain when the node should author a block.</li>
<li>A GRANDPA voting rule: A strategy for selecting chains to vote on in the GRANDPA algorithm to ensure that only valid
parachain candidates appear in finalized relay-chain blocks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="assumptions"><a class="header" href="#assumptions">Assumptions</a></h2>
<p>The Node-side code comes with a set of assumptions that we build upon. These assumptions encompass most of the
fundamental blockchain functionality.</p>
<p>We assume the following constraints regarding provided basic functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>The underlying <strong>consensus</strong> algorithm, whether it is BABE or SASSAFRAS is implemented.</li>
<li>There is a <strong>chain synchronization</strong> protocol which will search for and download the longest available chains at all
times.</li>
<li>The <strong>state</strong> of all blocks at the head of the chain is available. There may be <strong>state pruning</strong> such that state of
the last <code>k</code> blocks behind the last finalized block are available, as well as the state of all their descendants.
This assumption implies that the state of all active leaves and their last <code>k</code> ancestors are all available. The
underlying implementation is expected to support <code>k</code> of a few hundred blocks, but we reduce this to a very
conservative <code>k=5</code> for our purposes.</li>
<li>There is an underlying <strong>networking</strong> framework which provides <strong>peer discovery</strong> services which will provide us
with peers and will not create &quot;loopback&quot; connections to our own node. The number of peers we will have is assumed
to be bounded at 1000.</li>
<li>There is a <strong>transaction pool</strong> and a <strong>transaction propagation</strong> mechanism which maintains a set of current
transactions and distributes to connected peers. Current transactions are those which are not outdated relative to
some &quot;best&quot; fork of the chain, which is part of the active heads, and have not been included in the best fork.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="subsystems-and-jobs"><a class="header" href="#subsystems-and-jobs">Subsystems and Jobs</a></h1>
<p>In this section we define the notions of Subsystems and Jobs. These are
guidelines for how we will employ an architecture of hierarchical state
machines. We'll have a top-level state machine which oversees the next level of
state machines which oversee another layer of state machines and so on. The next
sections will lay out these guidelines for what we've called subsystems and
jobs, since this model applies to many of the tasks that the Node-side behavior
needs to encompass, but these are only guidelines and some Subsystems may have
deeper hierarchies internally.</p>
<p>Subsystems are long-lived worker tasks that are in charge of performing some
particular kind of work. All subsystems can communicate with each other via a
well-defined protocol. Subsystems can't generally communicate directly, but must
coordinate communication through an <a href="node/overseer.html">Overseer</a>, which is
responsible for relaying messages, handling subsystem failures, and dispatching
work signals.</p>
<p>Most work that happens on the Node-side is related to building on top of a
specific relay-chain block, which is contextually known as the &quot;relay parent&quot;.
We call it the relay parent to explicitly denote that it is a block in the relay
chain and not on a parachain. We refer to the parent because when we are in the
process of building a new block, we don't know what that new block is going to
be. The parent block is our only stable point of reference, even though it is
usually only useful when it is not yet a parent but in fact a leaf of the
block-DAG expected to soon become a parent (because validators are authoring on
top of it). Furthermore, we are assuming a forkful blockchain-extension
protocol, which means that there may be multiple possible children of the
relay-parent. Even if the relay parent has multiple children blocks, the parent
of those children is the same, and the context in which those children is
authored should be the same. The parent block is the best and most stable
reference to use for defining the scope of work items and messages, and is
typically referred to by its cryptographic hash.</p>
<p>Since this goal of determining when to start and conclude work relative to a
specific relay-parent is common to most, if not all subsystems, it is logically
the job of the Overseer to distribute those signals as opposed to each subsystem
duplicating that effort, potentially being out of synchronization with each
other. Subsystem A should be able to expect that subsystem B is working on the
same relay-parents as it is. One of the Overseer's tasks is to provide this
heartbeat, or synchronized rhythm, to the system.</p>
<p>The work that subsystems spawn to be done on a specific relay-parent is known as
a job. Subsystems should set up and tear down jobs according to the signals
received from the overseer. Subsystems may share or cache state between jobs.</p>
<p>Subsystems must be robust to spurious exits. The outputs of the set of
subsystems as a whole comprises of signed messages and data committed to disk.
Care must be taken to avoid issuing messages that are not substantiated. Since
subsystems need to be safe under spurious exits, it is the expected behavior
that an <code>OverseerSignal::Conclude</code> can just lead to breaking the loop and
exiting directly as opposed to waiting for everything to shut down gracefully.</p>
<h2 id="subsystem-message-traffic"><a class="header" href="#subsystem-message-traffic">Subsystem Message Traffic</a></h2>
<p>Which subsystems send messages to which other subsystems.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This diagram omits the overseer for simplicity. In fact, all messages
are relayed via the overseer.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Messages with a filled diamond arrowhead (&quot;♦&quot;) include a
<code>oneshot::Sender</code> which communicates a response from the recipient. Messages
with an open triangle arrowhead (&quot;Δ&quot;) do not include a return sender.</p>

<p>Let's contextualize that diagram a bit by following a parachain block from its
creation through finalization. Parachains can use completely arbitrary processes
to generate blocks. The relay chain doesn't know or care about the details; each
parachain just needs to provide a <a href="node/collators/collation-generation.html">collator</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Inter-subsystem communications are relayed via the overseer, but that
step is omitted here for brevity.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Dashed lines indicate a request/response cycle, where the response is
communicated asynchronously via a oneshot channel. Adjacent dashed lines may be
processed in parallel.</p>
<pre class="mermaid">sequenceDiagram

    end
</pre>
<p>The <code>DistributeCollation</code> messages that <code>CollationGeneration</code> sends to the
<code>CollatorProtocol</code> contains two items: a <code>CandidateReceipt</code> and <code>PoV</code>. The
<code>CollatorProtocol</code> is then responsible for distributing that collation to
interested validators. However, not all potential collations are of interest.
The <code>CandidateSelection</code> subsystem is responsible for determining which
collations are interesting, before <code>CollatorProtocol</code> actually fetches the
collation.</p>

    CS -&gt;&gt; NB: AdvertiseCollation
    NB -&gt;&gt; VS: AdvertiseCollation

    VS -&gt;&gt; CandidateSelection: Collation

    Note over CandidateSelection: Lots of other machinery in play here,&lt;br/&gt;but there are only three outcomes from the&lt;br/&gt;perspective of the `CollatorProtocol`:

    alt happy path
        CandidateSelection --&gt;&gt; VS: FetchCollation
        Activate VS
        VS -&gt;&gt; NB: RequestCollation
        NB -&gt;&gt; CS: RequestCollation

        VS -&gt;&gt; NB: ReportPeer

    else CandidateSelection already selected a different candidate
        Note over CandidateSelection: silently drop
    end
</pre>
<p>Assuming we hit the happy path, flow continues with <code>CandidateSelection</code>
receiving a <code>(candidate_receipt, pov)</code> as the return value from its
<code>FetchCollation</code> request. The only time <code>CandidateSelection</code> actively requests a
collation is when it hasn't yet seconded one for some <code>relay_parent</code>, and is
ready to second.</p>
<pre class="mermaid">sequenceDiagram

    % fn validate_and_make_available
    CB --&gt;&gt; CV: ValidateFromChainState

    Note over CB,CV: There's some complication in the source, as&lt;br/&gt;candidates are actually validated in a separate task.

    alt valid
        Note over CB: This is where we transform the CandidateReceipt into a CommittedCandidateReceipt
        % CandidateBackingJob::sign_import_and_distribute_statement
        % CandidateBackingJob::import_statement
        CB -&gt;&gt; PV: ProvisionableData::BackedCandidate

        opt if there is misbehavior to report
            CB -&gt;&gt; PV: ProvisionableData::MisbehaviorReport

    else invalid
        CB -&gt;&gt; CS: Invalid
    end
</pre>
<p>At this point, you'll see that control flows in two directions: to
<code>StatementDistribution</code> to distribute the <code>SignedStatement</code>, and to
<code>PoVDistribution</code> to distribute the <code>PoV</code>. However, that's largely a mirage:
while the initial implementation distributes <code>PoV</code>s by gossip, that's
inefficient, and will be replaced with a system which fetches <code>PoV</code>s only when
actually necessary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: figure out more precisely the current status and plans; write them up</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, we'll follow the <code>SignedStatement</code>. The <code>StatementDistribution</code>
subsystem is largely concerned with implementing a gossip protocol:</p>
<pre class="mermaid">sequenceDiagram
    participant SD as StatementDistribution
    participant NB as NetworkBridge

    alt On receipt of a&lt;br/&gt;SignedStatement from CandidateBacking
        % fn circulate_statement_and_dependents
        SD -&gt;&gt; NB: SendValidationMessage

        Note right of NB: Bridge sends validation message to all appropriate peers
    else On receipt of peer validation message
        NB -&gt;&gt; SD: NetworkBridgeUpdate

        % fn handle_incoming_message
        alt if we aren't already aware of the relay parent for this statement
            SD -&gt;&gt; NB: ReportPeer
        end

        % fn circulate_statement
        opt if we know of peers who haven't seen this message, gossip it
            SD -&gt;&gt; NB: SendValidationMessage
        end
    end
</pre>
<p>But who are these <code>Listener</code>s who've asked to be notified about incoming
<code>SignedStatement</code>s? Nobody, as yet.</p>
<p>Let's pick back up with the PoV Distribution subsystem.</p>
<pre class="mermaid">sequenceDiagram
    participant CB as CandidateBacking
    participant PD as PoVDistribution
    participant Listener
    participant NB as NetworkBridge

    CB -&gt;&gt; PD: DistributePoV

    Note over PD,Listener: Various subsystems can register listeners for when PoVs arrive

    loop for each Listener
        PD -&gt;&gt; Listener: Arc&lt;PoV&gt;
    end

    Note over PD: Gossip to connected peers

    PD -&gt;&gt; NB: SendPoV

    Note over PD,NB: On receipt of a network PoV, PovDistribution forwards it to each Listener.&lt;br/&gt;It also penalizes bad gossipers.
</pre>
<p>Unlike in the case of <code>StatementDistribution</code>, there is another subsystem which
in various circumstances already registers a listener to be notified when a new
<code>PoV</code> arrives: <code>CandidateBacking</code>. Note that this is the second time that
<code>CandidateBacking</code> has gotten involved. The first instance was from the
perspective of the validator choosing to second a candidate via its
<code>CandidateSelection</code> subsystem. This time, it's from the perspective of some
other validator, being informed that this foreign <code>PoV</code> has been received.</p>
<pre class="mermaid">sequenceDiagram
    participant SD as StatementDistribution
    participant CB as CandidateBacking
    participant PD as PoVDistribution
    participant AS as AvailabilityStore

    SD -&gt;&gt; CB: Statement
    % CB::maybe_validate_and_import =&gt; CB::kick_off_validation_work
    CB --&gt;&gt; PD: FetchPoV
    Note over CB,PD: This call creates the Listener from the previous diagram

    CB -&gt;&gt; AS: StoreAvailableData
</pre>
<p>At this point, things have gone a bit nonlinear. Let's pick up the thread again
with <code>BitfieldSigning</code>. As the <code>Overseer</code> activates each relay parent, it starts
a <code>BitfieldSigningJob</code> which operates on an extremely simple metric: after
creation, it immediately goes to sleep for 1.5 seconds. On waking, it records
the state of the world pertaining to availability at that moment.</p>
<pre class="mermaid">sequenceDiagram
    participant OS as Overseer
    participant BS as BitfieldSigning
    participant RA as RuntimeApi
    participant AS as AvailabilityStore
    participant BD as BitfieldDistribution

    OS -&gt;&gt; BS: ActiveLeavesUpdate
    loop for each activated relay parent
        Note over BS: Wait 1.5 seconds
        BS --&gt;&gt; RA: Request::AvailabilityCores
        loop for each availability core
            BS --&gt;&gt; AS: QueryChunkAvailability
        end
        BS -&gt;&gt; BD: DistributeBitfield
    end
</pre>
<p><code>BitfieldDistribution</code> is, like the other <code>*Distribution</code> subsystems, primarily
interested in implementing a peer-to-peer gossip network propagating its
particular messages. However, it also serves as an essential relay passing the
message along.</p>
<pre class="mermaid">sequenceDiagram
    participant BS as BitfieldSigning
    participant BD as BitfieldDistribution
    participant NB as NetworkBridge
    participant PV as Provisioner

    BS -&gt;&gt; BD: DistributeBitfield
    BD -&gt;&gt; PV: ProvisionableData::Bitfield
    BD -&gt;&gt; NB: SendValidationMessage::BitfieldDistribution::Bitfield
</pre>
<p>We've now seen the message flow to the <code>Provisioner</code>: both <code>CandidateBacking</code>
and <code>BitfieldDistribution</code> contribute provisionable data. Now, let's look at
that subsystem.</p>
<p>Much like the <code>BitfieldSigning</code> subsystem, the <code>Provisioner</code> creates a new job
for each newly-activated leaf, and starts a timer. Unlike <code>BitfieldSigning</code>, we
won't depict that part of the process, because the <code>Provisioner</code> also has other
things going on.</p>
<pre class="mermaid">sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Arbitrary
    participant PV as Provisioner
    participant CB as CandidateBacking
    participant BD as BitfieldDistribution
    participant RA as RuntimeApi
    participant PI as ParachainsInherentDataProvider

    alt receive provisionable data
        alt
            CB -&gt;&gt; PV: ProvisionableData
        else
            BD -&gt;&gt; PV: ProvisionableData
        end

        loop over stored Senders
            PV -&gt;&gt; A: ProvisionableData
        end

        Note over PV: store bitfields and backed candidates
    else receive request for inherent data
        PI -&gt;&gt; PV: RequestInherentData
        alt we have already constructed the inherent data
            PV -&gt;&gt; PI: send the inherent data
        else we have not yet constructed the inherent data
            Note over PV,PI: Store the return sender without sending immediately
        end
    else timer times out
        note over PV: Waited 2 seconds
        PV --&gt;&gt; RA: RuntimeApiRequest::AvailabilityCores
        Note over PV: construct and store the inherent data
        loop over stored inherent data requests
            PV -&gt;&gt; PI: (SignedAvailabilityBitfields, BackedCandidates)
        end
    end
</pre>
<p>In principle, any arbitrary subsystem could send a <code>RequestInherentData</code> to the
<code>Provisioner</code>. In practice, only the <code>ParachainsInherentDataProvider</code> does so.</p>
<p>The tuple <code>(SignedAvailabilityBitfields, BackedCandidates, ParentHeader)</code> is
injected by the <code>ParachainsInherentDataProvider</code> into the inherent data. From
that point on, control passes from the node to the runtime.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The overseer determines work to do based on block import events and block finalization events. It does this by keeping
track of the set of relay-parents for which work is currently being done. This is known as the &quot;active leaves&quot; set. It
determines an initial set of active leaves on startup based on the data on-disk, and uses events about blockchain import
to update the active leaves. Updates lead to
<a href="node/../types/overseer-protocol.html#overseer-signal"><code>OverseerSignal</code></a><code>::ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> being sent according to new
relay-parents, as well as relay-parents to stop considering. Block import events inform the overseer of leaves that no
longer need to be built on, now that they have children, and inform us to begin building on those children. Block
finalization events inform us when we can stop focusing on blocks that appear to have been orphaned.</p>
<p>The overseer is also responsible for tracking the freshness of active leaves. Leaves are fresh when they're encountered
for the first time, and stale when they're encountered for subsequent times. This can occur after chain reversions or
when the fork-choice rule abandons some chain. This distinction is used to manage <strong>Reversion Safety</strong>. Consensus
messages are often localized to a specific relay-parent, and it is often a misbehavior to equivocate or sign two
conflicting messages. When reverting the chain, we may begin work on a leaf that subsystems have already signed messages
for. Subsystems which need to account for reversion safety should avoid performing work on stale leaves.</p>
<p>The overseer's logic can be described with these functions:</p>
<h2 id="on-startup"><a class="header" href="#on-startup">On Startup</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Start all subsystems</li>
<li>Determine all blocks of the blockchain that should be built on. This should typically be the head of the best fork of
the chain we are aware of. Sometimes add recent forks as well.</li>
<li>Send an <code>OverseerSignal::ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> to all subsystems with <code>activated</code> containing each of these blocks.</li>
<li>Begin listening for block import and finality events</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="on-block-import-event"><a class="header" href="#on-block-import-event">On Block Import Event</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Apply the block import event to the active leaves. A new block should lead to its addition to the active leaves set
and its parent being deactivated.</li>
<li>Mark any stale leaves as stale. The overseer should track all leaves it activates to determine whether leaves are
fresh or stale.</li>
<li>Send an <code>OverseerSignal::ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> message to all subsystems containing all activated and deactivated
leaves.</li>
<li>Ensure all <code>ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> messages are flushed before resuming activity as a message router.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: in the future, we may want to avoid building on too many sibling blocks at once. the notion of a &quot;preferred
head&quot; among many competing sibling blocks would imply changes in our &quot;active leaves&quot; update rules here</p>

<p>Subsystems are essential tasks meant to run as long as the node does. Subsystems can spawn ephemeral work in the form of
jobs, but the subsystems themselves should not go down. If a subsystem goes down, it will be because of a critical error
that should take the entire node down as well.</p>
<h2 id="communication-between-subsystems"><a class="header" href="#communication-between-subsystems">Communication Between Subsystems</a></h2>
<p>When a subsystem wants to communicate with another subsystem, or, more typically, a job within a subsystem wants to
communicate with its counterpart under another subsystem, that communication must happen via the overseer. Consider this
example where a job on subsystem A wants to send a message to its counterpart under subsystem B. This is a realistic
scenario, where you can imagine that both jobs correspond to work under the same relay-parent.</p>

<p>First, the subsystem that spawned a job is responsible for handling the first step of the communication. The overseer is
not aware of the hierarchy of tasks within any given subsystem and is only responsible for subsystem-to-subsystem
communication. So the sending subsystem must pass on the message via the overseer to the receiving subsystem, in such a
way that the receiving subsystem can further address the communication to one of its internal tasks, if necessary.</p>
<p>This communication prevents a certain class of race conditions. When the Overseer determines that it is time for
subsystems to begin working on top of a particular relay-parent, it will dispatch a <code>ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> message to all
subsystems to do so, and those messages will be handled asynchronously by those subsystems. Some subsystems will receive
those messsages before others, and it is important that a message sent by subsystem A after receiving
<code>ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> message will arrive at subsystem B after its <code>ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> message. If subsystem A
maintained an independent channel with subsystem B to communicate, it would be possible for subsystem B to handle the
side message before the <code>ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> message, but it wouldn't have any logical course of action to take with the
side message - leading to it being discarded or improperly handled. Well-architectured state machines should have a
single source of inputs, so that is what we do here.</p>
<p>One exception is reasonable to make for responses to requests. A request should be made via the overseer in order to
ensure that it arrives after any relevant <code>ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> message. A subsystem issuing a request as a result of a
<code>ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> message can safely receive the response via a side-channel for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's impossible for a request to be answered before it arrives, it is provable that any response to a request obeys
the same ordering constraint.</li>
<li>The request was sent as a result of handling a <code>ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> message. Then there is no possible future in
which the <code>ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> message has not been handled upon the receipt of the response.</li>
</ol>
<p>So as a single exception to the rule that all communication must happen via the overseer we allow the receipt of
responses to requests via a side-channel, which may be established for that purpose. This simplifies any cases where the
outside world desires to make a request to a subsystem, as the outside world can then establish a side-channel to
receive the response on.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the overseer is not aware of the internals of subsystems, and this extends to the jobs that
they spawn. The overseer isn't aware of the existence or definition of those jobs, and is only aware of the outer
subsystems with which it interacts. This gives subsystem implementations leeway to define internal jobs as they see fit,
and to wrap a more complex hierarchy of state machines than having a single layer of jobs for relay-parent-based work.
Likewise, subsystems aren't required to spawn jobs. Certain types of subsystems, such as those for shared storage or
networking resources, won't perform block-based work but would still benefit from being on the Overseer's message bus.
These subsystems can just ignore the overseer's signals for block-based work.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the protocols by which subsystems communicate with each other should be well-defined irrespective of the
implementation of the subsystem. In other words, their interface should be distinct from their implementation. This will
prevent subsystems from accessing aspects of each other that are beyond the scope of the communication boundary.</p>

<p>Specifics on the motivation and types of constraints we apply to the GRANDPA voting logic as well as the definitions of
<strong>viable</strong> and <strong>finalizable</strong> blocks can be found in the <a href="node/../protocol-chain-selection.html">Chain Selection Protocol</a>
section. The subsystem which provides us with viable leaves is the <a href="node/utility/chain-selection.html">Chain Selection
Subsystem</a>.</p>
<p>GRANDPA's regular voting rule is for each validator to select the longest chain they are aware of. GRANDPA proceeds in
rounds, collecting information from all online validators and determines the blocks that a supermajority of validators
all have in common with each other.</p>
<p>The low-level GRANDPA logic will provide us with a <strong>required block</strong>. We can find the best leaf containing that block
in its chain with the
<a href="node/../types/overseer-protocol.html#chain-selection-message"><code>ChainSelectionMessage::BestLeafContaining</code></a>. If the result is
<code>None</code>, then we will simply cast a vote on the required block.</p>
<p>The <strong>viable</strong> leaves provided from the chain selection subsystem are not necessarily <strong>finalizable</strong>, so we need to
perform further work to discover the finalizable ancestor of the block. The first constraint is to avoid voting on any
unapproved block. The highest approved ancestor of a given block can be determined by querying the Approval Voting
subsystem via the <a href="node/../types/overseer-protocol.html#approval-voting"><code>ApprovalVotingMessage::ApprovedAncestor</code></a> message. If
the response is <code>Some</code>, we continue and apply the second constraint. The second constraint is to avoid voting on any
block containing a candidate undergoing an active dispute. The list of block hashes and candidates returned from
<code>ApprovedAncestor</code> should be reversed, and passed to the
<a href="node/../types/overseer-protocol.html#dispute-coordinator-message"><code>DisputeCoordinatorMessage::DetermineUndisputedChain</code></a> to
determine the <strong>finalizable</strong> block which will be our eventual vote.</p>

<p>Collators are special nodes which bridge a parachain to the relay chain. They are simultaneously full nodes of the
parachain, and at least light clients of the relay chain. Their overall contribution to the system is the generation of

<p>The Collator Protocol implements the network protocol by which collators and validators communicate. It is used by
collators to distribute collations to validators and used by validators to accept collations by collators.</p>
<p>Collator-to-Validator networking is more difficult than Validator-to-Validator networking because the set of possible
collators for any given para is unbounded, unlike the validator set. Validator-to-Validator networking protocols can
easily be implemented as gossip because the data can be bounded, and validators can authenticate each other by their
<code>PeerId</code>s for the purposes of instantiating and accepting connections.</p>
<p>Since, at least at the level of the para abstraction, the collator-set for any given para is unbounded, validators need
to make sure that they are receiving connections from capable and honest collators and that their bandwidth and time are
not being wasted by attackers. Communicating across this trust-boundary is the most difficult part of this subsystem.</p>
<p>Validation of candidates is a heavy task, and furthermore, the <a href="node/collators/../../types/availability.html#proofofvalidity"><code>PoV</code></a> itself is a large piece of data.
Empirically, <code>PoV</code>s are on the order of 10MB.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: note the incremental validation function Ximin proposes at https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/1348</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As this network protocol serves as a bridge between collators and validators, it communicates primarily with one
subsystem on behalf of each. As a collator, this will receive messages from the <a href="node/collators/collation-generation.html"><code>CollationGeneration</code></a> subsystem.
As a validator, this will communicate only with the <a href="node/collators/../backing/candidate-backing.html"><code>CandidateBacking</code></a>.</p>

<h3 id="collators-1"><a class="header" href="#collators-1">Collators</a></h3>
<p>It is assumed that collators are only collating on a single parachain. Collations are generated by the <a href="node/collators/collation-generation.html">Collation
Generation</a> subsystem. We will keep up to one local collation per relay-parent, based on <code>DistributeCollation</code>
messages. If the para is not scheduled on any core, at the relay-parent, or the relay-parent isn't in the active-leaves
set, we ignore the message as it must be invalid in that case - although this indicates a logic error elsewhere in the
node.</p>
<p>We keep track of the Para ID we are collating on as a collator. This starts as <code>None</code>, and is updated with each
<code>CollateOn</code> message received. If the <code>ParaId</code> of a collation requested to be distributed does not match the one we
expect, we ignore the message.</p>
<p>As with most other subsystems, we track the active leaves set by following <code>ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> signals.</p>
<p>For the purposes of actually distributing a collation, we need to be connected to the validators who are interested in
collations on that <code>ParaId</code> at this point in time. We assume that there is a discovery API for connecting to a set of
validators.</p>
<p>As seen in the <a href="node/collators/../../runtime/scheduler.html">Scheduler Module</a> of the runtime, validator groups are fixed for an entire session and their
rotations across cores are predictable. Collators will want to do these things when attempting to distribute collations
at a given relay-parent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine which core the para collated-on is assigned to.</li>
<li>Determine the group on that core.</li>
<li>Issue a discovery request for the validators of the current group
with<a href="node/collators/../../types/overseer-protocol.html#network-bridge-message"><code>NetworkBridgeMessage</code></a><code>::ConnectToValidators</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once connected to the relevant peers for the current group assigned to the core (transitively, the para), advertise the
collation to any of them which advertise the relay-parent in their view (as provided by the <a href="node/collators/../utility/network-bridge.html">Network Bridge</a>). If
any respond with a request for the full collation, provide it. However, we only send one collation at a time per relay
parent, other requests need to wait. This is done to reduce the bandwidth requirements of a collator and also increases
the chance to fully send the collation to at least one validator. From the point where one validator has received the
collation and seconded it, it will also start to share this collation with other validators in its backing group. Upon
receiving a view update from any of these peers which includes a relay-parent for which we have a collation that they
will find relevant, advertise the collation to them if we haven't already.</p>
<h3 id="validators-1"><a class="header" href="#validators-1">Validators</a></h3>
<p>On the validator side of the protocol, validators need to accept incoming connections from collators. They should keep
some peer slots open for accepting new speculative connections from collators and should disconnect from collators who
are not relevant.</p>

<p>When peers connect to us, they can <code>Declare</code> that they represent a collator with given public key and intend to collate
on a specific para ID. Once they've declared that, and we checked their signature, they can begin to send advertisements
of collations. The peers should not send us any advertisements for collations that are on a relay-parent outside of our
view or for a para outside of the one they've declared.</p>
<p>The protocol tracks advertisements received and the source of the advertisement. The advertisement source is the
<code>PeerId</code> of the peer who sent the message. We accept one advertisement per collator per source per relay-parent.</p>
<p>As a validator, we will handle requests from other subsystems to fetch a collation on a specific <code>ParaId</code> and
relay-parent. These requests are made with the request response protocol <code>CollationFetchingRequest</code> request. To do so,
we need to first check if we have already gathered a collation on that <code>ParaId</code> and relay-parent. If not, we need to
select one of the advertisements and issue a request for it. If we've already issued a request, we shouldn't issue
another one until the first has returned.</p>
<p>When acting on an advertisement, we issue a <code>Requests::CollationFetchingV1</code>. However, we only request one collation at a
time per relay parent. This reduces the bandwidth requirements and as we can second only one candidate per relay parent,
the others are probably not required anyway. If the request times out, we need to note the collator as being unreliable
and reduce its priority relative to other collators.</p>
<p>As a validator, once the collation has been fetched some other subsystem will inspect and do deeper validation of the
collation. The subsystem will report to this subsystem with a <a href="node/collators/../../types/overseer-protocol.html#collator-protocol-message"><code>CollatorProtocolMessage</code></a><code>::ReportCollator</code>. In
that case, if we are connected directly to the collator, we apply a cost to the <code>PeerId</code> associated with the collator
and potentially disconnect or blacklist it. If the collation is seconded, we notify the collator and apply a benefit to
the <code>PeerId</code> associated with the collator.</p>
<h3 id="interaction-with-candidate-backing"><a class="header" href="#interaction-with-candidate-backing">Interaction with <a href="node/collators/../backing/candidate-backing.html">Candidate Backing</a></a></h3>
<p>As collators advertise the availability, a validator will simply second the first valid parablock candidate per relay
head by sending a <a href="node/collators/../../types/overseer-protocol.html#candidate-backing-mesage"><code>CandidateBackingMessage</code></a><code>::Second</code>. Note that this message contains the relay parent of the
advertised collation, the candidate receipt and the <a href="node/collators/../../types/availability.html#proofofvalidity">PoV</a>.</p>
<p>Subsequently, once a valid parablock candidate has been seconded, the <a href="node/collators/../backing/candidate-backing.html"><code>CandidateBacking</code></a> subsystem will send a
<a href="node/collators/../../types/overseer-protocol.html#collator-protocol-message"><code>CollatorProtocolMessage</code></a><code>::Seconded</code>, which will trigger this subsystem to notify the collator at the <code>PeerId</code>
that first advertised the parablock on the seconded relay head of their successful seconding.</p>
<h2 id="future-work-1"><a class="header" href="#future-work-1">Future Work</a></h2>
<p>Several approaches have been discussed, but all have some issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The current approach is very straightforward. However, that protocol is vulnerable to a single collator which, as an
attack or simply through chance, gets its block candidate to the node more often than its fair share of the time.</li>
<li>If collators produce blocks via Aura, BABE or in future Sassafras, it may be possible to choose an &quot;Official&quot; collator
for the round, but it may be tricky to ensure that the PVF logic is enforced at collator leader election.</li>
<li>We could use relay-chain BABE randomness to generate some delay <code>D</code> on the order of 1 second, +* 1 second. The
collator would then second the first valid parablock which arrives after <code>D</code>, or in case none has arrived by <code>2*D</code>,
the last valid parablock which has arrived. This makes it very hard for a collator to game the system to always get
its block nominated, but it reduces the maximum throughput of the system by introducing delay into an already tight
schedule.</li>
<li>A variation of that scheme would be to have a fixed acceptance window <code>D</code> for parablock candidates and keep track of
count <code>C</code>: the number of parablock candidates received. At the end of the period <code>D</code>, we choose a random number I in
the range <code>[0, C)</code> and second the block at Index I. Its drawback is the same: it must wait the full <code>D</code> period before
seconding any of its received candidates, reducing throughput.</li>
<li>In order to protect against DoS attacks, it may be prudent to run throw out collations from collators that have
behaved poorly (whether recently or historically) and subsequently only verify the PoV for the most suitable of
collations.</li>
</ul>
<footer id="last-change">Last change: 2023-09-04, commit: <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/commit/a30092ab42">a30092ab42</a></footer><div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="backing-subsystems"><a class="header" href="#backing-subsystems">Backing Subsystems</a></h1>
<p>The backing subsystems, when conceived as a black box, receive an arbitrary quantity of parablock candidates and
associated proofs of validity from arbitrary untrusted collators. From these, they produce a bounded quantity of
backable candidates which relay chain block authors may choose to include in a subsequent block.</p>
<p>In broad strokes, the flow operates like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Candidate Selection</strong> winnows the field of parablock candidates, selecting up to one of them to second.</li>
<li><strong>Candidate Backing</strong> ensures that a seconding candidate is valid, then generates the appropriate <code>Statement</code>. It also
keeps track of which candidates have received the backing of a quorum of other validators.</li>
<li><strong>Statement Distribution</strong> is the networking component which ensures that all validators receive each others'
statements.</li>
<li><strong>PoV Distribution</strong> is the networking component which ensures that validators considering a candidate can get the
appropriate PoV.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="candidate-backing"><a class="header" href="#candidate-backing">Candidate Backing</a></h1>
<p>The Candidate Backing subsystem ensures every parablock considered for relay block inclusion has been seconded by at
least one validator, and approved by a quorum. Parablocks for which not enough validators will assert correctness are
discarded. If the block later proves invalid, the initial backers are slashable; this gives Polkadot a rational threat
model during subsequent stages.</p>
<p>Its role is to produce backable candidates for inclusion in new relay-chain blocks. It does so by issuing signed
<a href="node/backing/../../types/backing.html#statement-type"><code>Statement</code>s</a> and tracking received statements signed by other validators. Once enough statements are
received, they can be combined into backing for specific candidates.</p>
<p>Note that though the candidate backing subsystem attempts to produce as many backable candidates as possible, it does
<em>not</em> attempt to choose a single authoritative one. The choice of which actually gets included is ultimately up to the
block author, by whatever metrics it may use; those are opaque to this subsystem.</p>
<p>Once a sufficient quorum has agreed that a candidate is valid, this subsystem notifies the <a href="node/backing/../utility/provisioner.html">Provisioner</a>, which in
turn engages block production mechanisms to include the parablock.</p>

<p>The <a href="node/backing/../collators/collator-protocol.html">Collator Protocol</a> subsystem is the primary source of non-overseer messages into this subsystem. That subsystem
generates appropriate <a href="node/backing/../../types/overseer-protocol.html#candidate-backing-message"><code>CandidateBackingMessage</code>s</a> and passes them to this subsystem.</p>
<p>This subsystem requests validation from the <a href="node/backing/../utility/candidate-validation.html">Candidate Validation</a> and generates an appropriate
<a href="node/backing/../../types/backing.html#statement-type"><code>Statement</code></a>. All <code>Statement</code>s are then passed on to the <a href="node/backing/statement-distribution.html">Statement Distribution</a> subsystem to be
gossiped to peers. When <a href="node/backing/../utility/candidate-validation.html">Candidate Validation</a> decides that a candidate is invalid, and it was recommended to us to
second by our own <a href="node/backing/../collators/collator-protocol.html">Collator Protocol</a> subsystem, a message is sent to the <a href="node/backing/../collators/collator-protocol.html">Collator Protocol</a> subsystem with the
candidate's hash so that the collator which recommended it can be penalized.</p>
<p>The subsystem should maintain a set of handles to Candidate Backing Jobs that are currently live, as well as the
relay-parent to which they correspond.</p>

<h2 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Tracks and handles prospective parachain fragments and informs
other backing-stage subsystems of work to be done.</p>
<p>&quot;prospective&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li>[<em>prə'spɛktɪv</em>] adj.</li>
<li>future, likely, potential</li>
</ul>
<p>Asynchronous backing changes the runtime to accept parachain candidates from a
certain allowed range of historic relay-parents. This means we can now build
<em>prospective parachains</em> – that is, trees of potential (but likely) future
parachain blocks. This is the subsystem responsible for doing so.</p>
<p>Other subsystems such as Backing rely on Prospective Parachains, e.g. for
determining if a candidate can be seconded. This subsystem is the main
coordinator of work within the node for the collation and backing phases of
parachain consensus.</p>
<p>Prospective Parachains is primarily an implementation of fragment trees. It also
handles concerns such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>the relay-chain being forkful</li>
<li>session changes</li>
</ul>
<p>See the following sections for more details.</p>
<h3 id="fragment-trees"><a class="header" href="#fragment-trees">Fragment Trees</a></h3>
<p>This subsystem builds up fragment trees, which are trees of prospective para
candidates. Each path through the tree represents a possible state transition
path for the para. Each potential candidate is a fragment, or a node, in the
tree. Candidates are validated against constraints as they are added.</p>
<p>This subsystem builds up trees for each relay-chain block in the view, for each
para. These fragment trees are used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>providing backable candidates to other subsystems</li>
<li>sanity-checking that candidates can be seconded</li>
<li>getting seconded candidates under active leaves</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, here is a tree with several possible paths:</p>
<pre><code>Para Head registered by the relay chain:     included_head
                                                  ↲  ↳
depth 0:                                  head_0_a    head_0_b
                                             ↲            ↳
depth 1:                             head_1_a              head_1_b
                                  ↲      |     ↳
depth 2:                 head_2_a1   head_2_a2  head_2_a3
</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-relay-chain-being-forkful"><a class="header" href="#the-relay-chain-being-forkful">The Relay-Chain Being Forkful</a></h3>
<p>We account for the same candidate possibly appearing in different forks. While
we still build fragment trees for each head in each fork, we are efficient with
how we reference candidates to save space.</p>
<h3 id="session-changes"><a class="header" href="#session-changes">Session Changes</a></h3>
<p>Allowed ancestry doesn't cross session boundary. That is, you can only build on
top of the freshest relay parent when the session starts. This is a current
limitation that may be lifted in the future.</p>
<p>Also, runtime configuration values needed for constraints (such as
<code>max_pov_size</code>) are constant within a session. This is important when building

<p>This subsystem is responsible for distributing signed statements that we have generated and forwarding statements
generated by our peers. Received candidate receipts and statements are passed to the <a href="node/backing/candidate-backing.html">Candidate Backing
subsystem</a> to handle producing local statements. On receiving
<code>StatementDistributionMessage::Share</code>, this subsystem distributes the message across the network with redundency to
ensure a fast backing process.</p>
<h2 id="overview-1"><a class="header" href="#overview-1">Overview</a></h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> every well-connected node is aware of every next potential parachain block.</p>
<p>Validators can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>receive parachain block from collator, check block, and gossip statement.</li>
<li>receive statements from other validators, check the parachain block if it originated within their own group, gossip
forward statement if valid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Validators must have statements, candidates, and persisted validation from all other validators. This is because we need
to store statements from validators who've checked the candidate on the relay chain, so we know who to hold accountable
in case of disputes. Any validator can be selected as the next relay-chain block author, and this is not revealed in
advance for security reasons. As a result, all validators must have a up to date view of all possible parachain
candidates + backing statements that could be placed on-chain in the next block.</p>
<p><a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/polkadot-v1-0-sharding-and-economic-security">This blog post</a> puts it another way:
&quot;Validators who aren't assigned to the parachain still listen for the attestations [statements] because whichever
validator ends up being the author of the relay-chain block needs to bundle up attested parachain blocks for several
parachains and place them into the relay-chain block.&quot;</p>
<p>Backing-group quorum (that is, enough backing group votes) must be reached before the block author will consider the
candidate. Therefore, validators need to consider <em>all</em> seconded candidates within their own group, because that's what
they're assigned to work on. Validators only need to consider <em>backable</em> candidates from other groups. This informs the
design of the statement distribution protocol to have separate phases for in-group and out-group distribution,
respectively called &quot;cluster&quot; and &quot;grid&quot; mode (see below).</p>
<h3 id="with-async-backing"><a class="header" href="#with-async-backing">With Async Backing</a></h3>
<p>Asynchronous backing changes the runtime to accept parachain candidates from a certain allowed range of historic
relay-parents. These candidates must be backed by the group assigned to the parachain as-of their corresponding relay
parents.</p>
<h2 id="protocol-4"><a class="header" href="#protocol-4">Protocol</a></h2>
<p>To address the concern of dealing with large numbers of spam candidates or statements, the overall design approach is to
combine a focused &quot;clustering&quot; protocol for legitimate fresh candidates with a broad-distribution &quot;grid&quot; protocol to
quickly get backed candidates into the hands of many validators. Validators do not eagerly send each other heavy
<code>CommittedCandidateReceipt</code>, but instead request these lazily through request/response protocols.</p>
<p>A high-level description of the protocol follows:</p>
<h3 id="messages-2"><a class="header" href="#messages-2">Messages</a></h3>
<p>Nodes can send each other a few kinds of messages: <code>Statement</code>, <code>BackedCandidateManifest</code>,
<code>BackedCandidateAcknowledgement</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Statement</code> messages contain only a signed compact statement, without full candidate info.</li>
<li><code>BackedCandidateManifest</code> messages advertise a description of a backed candidate and stored statements.</li>
<li><code>BackedCandidateAcknowledgement</code> messages acknowledge that a backed candidate is fully known.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="requestresponse-protocol"><a class="header" href="#requestresponse-protocol">Request/response protocol</a></h3>
<p>Nodes can request the full <code>CommittedCandidateReceipt</code> and <code>PersistedValidationData</code>, along with statements, over a
request/response protocol. This is the <code>AttestedCandidateRequest</code>; the response is <code>AttestedCandidateResponse</code>.</p>
<h3 id="importability-and-the-hypothetical-frontier"><a class="header" href="#importability-and-the-hypothetical-frontier">Importability and the Hypothetical Frontier</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>prospective parachains</strong> subsystem maintains prospective &quot;fragment trees&quot; which can be used to determine whether a
particular parachain candidate could possibly be included in the future. Candidates which either are within a fragment
tree or <em>would be</em> part of a fragment tree if accepted are said to be in the &quot;hypothetical frontier&quot;.</p>
<p>The <strong>statement-distribution</strong> subsystem keeps track of all candidates, and updates its knowledge of the hypothetical
frontier based on events such as new relay parents, new confirmed candidates, and newly backed candidates.</p>
<p>We only consider statements as &quot;importable&quot; when the corresponding candidate is part of the hypothetical frontier, and
only send &quot;importable&quot; statements to the backing subsystem itself.</p>
<h3 id="cluster-mode"><a class="header" href="#cluster-mode">Cluster Mode</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Validator nodes are partitioned into groups (with some exceptions), and validators within a group at a relay-parent
can send each other <code>Statement</code> messages for any candidates within that group and based on that relay-parent.</li>
<li>This is referred to as the &quot;cluster&quot; mode.
<ul>
<li>Right now these are the same as backing groups, though &quot;cluster&quot; specifically refers to the set of nodes
communicating with each other in the first phase of distribution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Seconded</code> statements must be sent before <code>Valid</code> statements.</li>
<li><code>Seconded</code> statements may only be sent to other members of the group when the candidate is fully known by the local
validator.
<ul>
<li>&quot;Fully known&quot; means the validator has the full <code>CommittedCandidateReceipt</code> and <code>PersistedValidationData</code>, which it
receives on request from other validators or from a collator.</li>
<li>The reason for this is that sending a statement (which is always a <code>CompactStatement</code> carrying nothing but a hash
and signature) to the cluster, is also a signal that the sending node is available to request the candidate from.</li>
<li>This makes the protocol easier to reason about, while also reducing network messages about candidates that don't
really exist.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Validators in a cluster receiving messages about unknown candidates request the candidate (and statements) from other
cluster members which have it.</li>
<li>Spam considerations
<ul>
<li>The maximum depth of candidates allowed in asynchronous backing determines the maximum amount of <code>Seconded</code>
statements originating from a validator V which each validator in a cluster may send to others. This bounds the
number of candidates.</li>
<li>There is a small number of validators in each group, which further limits the amount of candidates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We accept candidates which don't fit in the fragment trees of any relay parents.
<ul>
<li>&quot;Accept&quot; means &quot;attempt to request and store in memory until useful or expired&quot;.</li>
<li>We listen to prospective parachains subsystem to learn of new additions to the fragment trees.</li>
<li>Use this to attempt to import the candidate later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="grid-mode"><a class="header" href="#grid-mode">Grid Mode</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Every consensus session provides randomness and a fixed validator set, which is used to build a redundant grid
topology.
<ul>
<li>It's redundant in the sense that there are 2 paths from every node to every other node. See &quot;Grid Topology&quot; section
for more details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This grid topology is used to create a sending path from each validator group to every validator.</li>
<li>When a node observes a candidate as backed, it sends a <code>BackedCandidateManifest</code> to their &quot;receiving&quot; nodes.</li>
<li>If receiving nodes don't yet know the candidate, they request it.</li>
<li>Once they know the candidate, they respond with a <code>BackedCandidateAcknowledgement</code>.</li>
<li>Once two nodes perform a manifest/acknowledgement exchange, they can send <code>Statement</code> messages directly to each other
for any new statements they might need.
<ul>
<li>This limits the amount of statements we'd have to deal with w.r.t. candidates that don't really exist. See &quot;Manifest
Exchange&quot; section.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are limitations on the number of candidates that can be advertised by each peer, similar to those in the
cluster. Validators do not request candidates which exceed these limitations.</li>
<li>Validators request candidates as soon as they are advertised, but do not import the statements until the candidate is
part of the hypothetical frontier, and do not re-advertise or acknowledge until the candidate is considered both
backable and part of the hypothetical frontier.</li>
<li>Note that requesting is not an implicit acknowledgement, and an explicit acknowledgement must be sent upon receipt.</li>

<h2 id="manifests"><a class="header" href="#manifests">Manifests</a></h2>
<p>A manifest is a message about a known backed candidate, along with a description of the statements backing it. It can be
one of two kinds:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Full</code>: Contains information about the candidate and should be sent to peers who may not have the candidate yet. This
is also called an <code>Announcement</code>.</li>
<li><code>Acknowledgement</code>: Omits information implicit in the candidate, and should be sent to peers which are guaranteed to
have the candidate already.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="manifest-exchange"><a class="header" href="#manifest-exchange">Manifest Exchange</a></h3>
<p>Manifest exchange is when a receiving node received a <code>Full</code> manifest and replied with an <code>Acknowledgement</code>. It
indicates that both nodes know the candidate as valid and backed. This allows the nodes to send <code>Statement</code> messages
directly to each other for any new statements.</p>
<p>Why? This limits the amount of statements we'd have to deal with w.r.t. candidates that don't really exist. Limiting
out-of-group statement distribution between peers to only candidates that both peers agree are backed and exist ensures
we only have to store statements about real candidates.</p>
<p>In practice, manifest exchange means that one of three things have happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>They announced, we acknowledged.</li>
<li>We announced, they acknowledged.</li>
<li>We announced, they announced.</li>
</ul>
<p>Concerning the last case, note that it is possible for two nodes to have each other in their sending set. Consider:</p>
<pre><code>1 2
3 4
</code></pre>
<p>If validators 2 and 4 are in group B, then there is a path <code>2-&gt;1-&gt;3</code> and <code>4-&gt;3-&gt;1</code>. Therefore, 1 and 3 might send each
other manifests for the same candidate at the same time, without having seen the other's yet. This also counts as a
manifest exchange, but is only allowed to occur in this way.</p>
<p>After the exchange is complete, we update pending statements. Pending statements are those we know locally that the
remote node does not.</p>
<h4 id="alternative-paths-through-the-topology"><a class="header" href="#alternative-paths-through-the-topology">Alternative Paths Through The Topology</a></h4>
<p>Nodes should send a <code>BackedCandidateAcknowledgement(CandidateHash, StatementFilter)</code> notification to any peer which has
sent a manifest, and the candidate has been acquired by other means. This keeps alternative paths through the topology
open, which allows nodes to receive additional statements that come later, but not after the candidate has been posted
on-chain.</p>
<p>This is mostly about the limitation that the runtime has no way for block authors to post statements that come after the
parablock is posted on-chain and ensure those validators still get rewarded. Technically, we only need enough statements
to back the candidate and the manifest + request will provide that. But more statements might come shortly afterwards,
and we want those to end up on-chain as well to ensure all validators in the group are rewarded.</p>
<p>For clarity, here is the full timeline:</p>
<ol>
<li>candidate seconded</li>
<li>backable in cluster</li>
<li>distributed along grid</li>
<li>latecomers issue statements</li>
<li>candidate posted on chain</li>
<li>really latecomers issue statements</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="cluster-module"><a class="header" href="#cluster-module">Cluster Module</a></h2>
<p>The cluster module provides direct distribution of unbacked candidates within a group. By utilizing this initial phase
of propagating only within clusters/groups, we bound the number of <code>Seconded</code> messages per validator per relay-parent,
helping us prevent spam. Validators can try to circumvent this, but they would only consume a few KB of memory and it is
trivially slashable on chain.</p>
<p>The cluster module determines whether to accept/reject messages from other validators in the same group. It keeps track
of what we have sent to other validators in the group, and pending statements. For the full protocol, see &quot;Protocol&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="grid-module"><a class="header" href="#grid-module">Grid Module</a></h2>
<p>The grid module provides distribution of backed candidates and late statements outside the backing group. For the full
protocol, see the &quot;Protocol&quot; section.</p>
<h3 id="grid-topology"><a class="header" href="#grid-topology">Grid Topology</a></h3>
<p>For distributing outside our cluster (aka backing group) we use a 2D grid topology. This limits the amount of peers we
send messages to, and handles view updates.</p>
<p>The basic operation of the grid topology is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>A validator producing a message sends it to its row-neighbors and its column-neighbors.</li>
<li>A validator receiving a message originating from one of its row-neighbors sends it to its column-neighbors.</li>
<li>A validator receiving a message originating from one of its column-neighbors sends it to its row-neighbors.</li>
</ul>
<p>This grid approach defines 2 unique paths for every validator to reach every other validator in at most 2 hops,
providing redundancy.</p>
<p>Propagation follows these rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each node has a receiving set and a sending set. These are different for each group. That is, if a node receives a
candidate from group A, it checks if it is allowed to receive from that node for candidates from group A.</li>
<li>For groups that we are in, receive from nobody and send to our X/Y peers.</li>
<li>For groups that we are not part of:
<ul>
<li>We receive from any validator in the group we share a slice with and send to the corresponding X/Y slice in the
other dimension.</li>
<li>For any validators we don't share a slice with, we receive from the nodes which share a slice with them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example"><a class="header" href="#example">Example</a></h3>
<p>For size 11, the matrix would be:</p>
<pre><code>0  1  2
3  4  5
6  7  8
9 10
</code></pre>
<p>e.g. for index 10, the neighbors would be 1, 4, 7, 9 -- these are the nodes we could directly communicate with (e.g.
either send to or receive from).</p>
<p>Now, which of these neighbors can 10 receive from? Recall that the sending/receiving sets for 10 would be different for
different groups. Here are some hypothetical scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> 9 belongs to group A but not 10. Here, 10 can directly receive candidates from group A from 9. 10
would propagate them to the nodes in {1, 4, 7} that are not in A.</li>
<li><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> 6 is in group A instead of 9, and 7 is not in group A. 10 can receive group A messages from 7 or 9. 10
will try to relay these messages, but 7 and 9 together should have already propagated the message to all x/y peers of
10. If so, then 10 will just receive acknowledgements in reply rather than requests.</li>
<li><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> 10 itself is in group A. 10 would not receive candidates from this group from any other nodes through
the grid. It would itself send such candidates to all its neighbors that are not in A.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="seconding-limit"><a class="header" href="#seconding-limit">Seconding Limit</a></h3>
<p>The seconding limit is a per-validator limit. Before asynchronous backing, we had a rule that every validator was only
allowed to second one candidate per relay parent. With asynchronous backing, we have a 'maximum depth' which makes it
possible to second multiple candidates per relay parent. The seconding limit is set to <code>max depth + 1</code> to set an upper
bound on candidates entering the system.</p>
<h2 id="candidates-module"><a class="header" href="#candidates-module">Candidates Module</a></h2>
<p>The candidates module provides a tracker for all known candidates in the view, whether they are confirmed or not, and
how peers have advertised the candidates. What is a confirmed candidate? It is a candidate for which we have the full
receipt and the persisted validation data. This module gets confirmed candidates from two sources:</p>
<ul>

<p>Implemented as a gossip protocol. Handles updates to our view and peers' views. Neighbor packets are used to inform
peers which chain heads we are interested in data for.</p>
<p>The Statement Distribution Subsystem is responsible for distributing signed statements that we have generated and for
forwarding statements generated by other validators. It also detects a variety of Validator misbehaviors for reporting
to the <a href="node/backing/../utility/provisioner.html">Provisioner Subsystem</a>. During the Backing stage of the inclusion pipeline, Statement
Distribution is the main point of contact with peer nodes. On receiving a signed statement from a peer in the same
backing group, assuming the peer receipt state machine is in an appropriate state, it sends the Candidate Receipt to the
<a href="node/backing/candidate-backing.html">Candidate Backing subsystem</a> to handle the validator's statement. On receiving
<code>StatementDistributionMessage::Share</code> we make sure to send messages to our backing group in addition to random other
peers, to ensure a fast backing process and getting all statements quickly for distribution.</p>
<p>This subsystem tracks equivocating validators and stops accepting information from them. It establishes a
data-dependency order:</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to receive a <code>Seconded</code> message we have the corresponding chain head in our view</li>
<li>In order to receive a <code>Valid</code> message we must have received the corresponding <code>Seconded</code> message.</li>
</ul>
<p>And respect this data-dependency order from our peers by respecting their views. This subsystem is responsible for
checking message signatures.</p>
<p>The Statement Distribution subsystem sends statements to peer nodes.</p>
<h2 id="peer-receipt-state-machine"><a class="header" href="#peer-receipt-state-machine">Peer Receipt State Machine</a></h2>
<p>There is a very simple state machine which governs which messages we are willing to receive from peers. Not depicted in
the state machine: on initial receipt of any <a href="node/backing/../../types/backing.html#signed-statement-type"><code>SignedFullStatement</code></a>,
validate that the provided signature does in fact sign the included data. Note that each individual parablock candidate
gets its own instance of this state machine; it is perfectly legal to receive a <code>Valid(X)</code> before a <code>Seconded(Y)</code>, as
long as a <code>Seconded(X)</code> has been received.</p>
<p>A: Initial State. Receive <code>SignedFullStatement(Statement::Second)</code>: extract <code>Statement</code>, forward to Candidate Backing,
proceed to B. Receive any other <code>SignedFullStatement</code> variant: drop it.</p>
<p>B: Receive any <code>SignedFullStatement</code>: check signature and determine whether the statement is new to us. if new, forward
to Candidate Backing and circulate to other peers. Receive <code>OverseerMessage::StopWork</code>: proceed to C.</p>
<p>C: Receive any message for this block: drop it.</p>
<p>For large statements (see below), we also keep track of the total received large statements per peer and have a hard
limit on that number for flood protection. This is necessary as in the current code we only forward statements once we
have all the data, therefore flood protection for large statement is a bit more subtle. This will become an obsolete
problem once <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/2979">off chain code upgrades</a> are implemented.</p>
<h2 id="peer-knowledge-tracking"><a class="header" href="#peer-knowledge-tracking">Peer Knowledge Tracking</a></h2>
<p>The peer receipt state machine implies that for parsimony of network resources, we should model the knowledge of our
peers, and help them out. For example, let's consider a case with peers A, B, and C, validators X and Y, and candidate
M. A sends us a <code>Statement::Second(M)</code> signed by X. We've double-checked it, and it's valid. While we're checking it, we
receive a copy of X's <code>Statement::Second(M)</code> from <code>B</code>, along with a <code>Statement::Valid(M)</code> signed by Y.</p>
<p>Our response to A is just the <code>Statement::Valid(M)</code> signed by Y. However, we haven't heard anything about this from C.
Therefore, we send it everything we have: first a copy of X's <code>Statement::Second</code>, then Y's <code>Statement::Valid</code>.</p>
<p>This system implies a certain level of duplication of messages--we received X's <code>Statement::Second</code> from both our peers,
and C may experience the same--but it minimizes the degree to which messages are simply dropped.</p>
<p>And respect this data-dependency order from our peers. This subsystem is responsible for checking message signatures.</p>
<p>No jobs. We follow view changes from the <a href="node/backing/../utility/network-bridge.html"><code>NetworkBridge</code></a>, which in turn is updated by
the overseer.</p>
<h2 id="equivocations-and-flood-protection"><a class="header" href="#equivocations-and-flood-protection">Equivocations and Flood Protection</a></h2>
<p>An equivocation is a double-vote by a validator. The <a href="node/backing/candidate-backing.html">Candidate Backing</a> Subsystem is
better-suited than this one to detect equivocations as it adds votes to quorum trackers.</p>
<p>At this level, we are primarily concerned about flood-protection, and to some extent, detecting equivocations is a part
of that. In particular, we are interested in detecting equivocations of <code>Seconded</code> statements. Since every other
statement is dependent on <code>Seconded</code> statements, ensuring that we only ever hold a bounded number of <code>Seconded</code>
statements is sufficient for flood-protection.</p>
<p>The simple approach is to say that we only receive up to two <code>Seconded</code> statements per validator per chain head.
However, the marginal cost of equivocation, conditional on having already equivocated, is close to 0, since a single
double-vote offence is counted as all double-vote offences for a particular chain-head. Even if it were not, there is
some amount of equivocations that can be done such that the marginal cost of issuing further equivocations is close to
0, as there would be an amount of equivocations necessary to be completely and totally obliterated by the slashing
algorithm. We fear the validator with nothing left to lose.</p>
<p>With that in mind, this simple approach has a caveat worth digging deeper into.</p>
<p>First: We may be aware of two equivocated <code>Seconded</code> statements issued by a validator. A totally honest peer of ours can
also be aware of one or two different <code>Seconded</code> statements issued by the same validator. And yet another peer may be
aware of one or two <em>more</em> <code>Seconded</code> statements. And so on. This interacts badly with pre-emptive sending logic. Upon
sending a <code>Seconded</code> statement to a peer, we will want to pre-emptively follow up with all statements relative to that
candidate. Waiting for acknowledgment introduces latency at every hop, so that is best avoided. What can happen is that
upon receipt of the <code>Seconded</code> statement, the peer will discard it as it falls beyond the bound of 2 that it is allowed
to store. It cannot store anything in memory about discarded candidates as that would introduce a DoS vector. Then, the
peer would receive from us all of the statements pertaining to that candidate, which, from its perspective, would be
undesired - they are data-dependent on the <code>Seconded</code> statement we sent them, but they have erased all record of that
from their memory. Upon receiving a potential flood of undesired statements, this 100% honest peer may choose to
disconnect from us. In this way, an adversary may be able to partition the network with careful distribution of
equivocated <code>Seconded</code> statements.</p>
<p>The fix is to track, per-peer, the hashes of up to 4 candidates per validator (per relay-parent) that the peer is aware
of. It is 4 because we may send them 2 and they may send us 2 different ones. We track the data that they are aware of
as the union of things we have sent them and things they have sent us. If we receive a 1st or 2nd <code>Seconded</code> statement
from a peer, we note it in the peer's known candidates even if we do disregard the data locally. And then, upon receipt
of any data dependent on that statement, we do not reduce that peer's standing in our eyes, as the data was not
undesired.</p>
<p>There is another caveat to the fix: we don't want to allow the peer to flood us because it has set things up in a way
that it knows we will drop all of its traffic. We also track how many statements we have received per peer, per
candidate, and per chain-head. This is any statement concerning a particular candidate: <code>Seconded</code>, <code>Valid</code>, or
<code>Invalid</code>. If we ever receive a statement from a peer which would push any of these counters beyond twice the amount of
validators at the chain-head, we begin to lower the peer's standing and eventually disconnect. This bound is a massive
overestimate and could be reduced to twice the number of validators in the corresponding validator group. It is worth
noting that the goal at the time of writing is to ensure any finite bound on the amount of stored data, as any
equivocation results in a large slash.</p>
<h2 id="large-statements"><a class="header" href="#large-statements">Large statements</a></h2>
<p>Seconded statements can become quite large on parachain runtime upgrades for example. For this reason, there exists a
<code>LargeStatement</code> constructor for the <code>StatementDistributionMessage</code> wire message, which only contains light metadata of
a statement. The actual candidate data is not included. This message type is used whenever a message is deemed large.
The receiver of such a message needs to request the actual payload via request/response by means of a
<code>StatementFetchingV1</code> request.</p>
<p>This is necessary as distribution of a large payload (mega bytes) via gossip would make the network collapse and timely
distribution of statements would no longer be possible. By using request/response it is ensured that each peer only
transferes large data once. We only take good care to detect an overloaded peer early and immediately move on to a
different peer for fetching the data. This mechanism should result in a good load distribution and therefore a rather
optimal distribution path.</p>
<p>With these optimizations, distribution of payloads in the size of up to 3 to 4 MB should work with Kusama validator
specifications. For scaling up even more, runtime upgrades and message passing should be done off chain at some point.</p>
<p>Flood protection considerations: For making DoS attacks slightly harder on this subsystem, nodes will only respond to
large statement requests, when they previously notified that peer via gossip about that statement. So, it is not
possible to DoS nodes at scale, by requesting candidate data over and over again.</p>

<p>The availability subsystems are responsible for ensuring that Proofs of Validity of backed candidates are widely
available within the validator set, without requiring every node to retain a full copy. They accomplish this by broadly
distributing erasure-coded chunks of the PoV, keeping track of which validator has which chunk by means of signed
bitfields. They are also responsible for reassembling a complete PoV when required, e.g. when an approval checker needs
to validate a parachain block.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="availability-distribution"><a class="header" href="#availability-distribution">Availability Distribution</a></h1>
<p>This subsystem is responsible for distribution availability data to peers. Availability data are chunks, <code>PoV</code>s and
<code>AvailableData</code> (which is <code>PoV</code> + <code>PersistedValidationData</code>). It does so via request response protocols.</p>
<p>In particular this subsystem is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Respond to network requests requesting availability data by querying the <a href="node/availability/../utility/availability-store.html">Availability
Store</a>.</li>
<li>Request chunks from backing validators to put them in the local <code>Availability Store</code> whenever we find an occupied core
on any fresh leaf, this is to ensure availability by at least 2/3+ of all validators, this happens after a candidate
is backed.</li>
<li>Fetch <code>PoV</code> from validators, when requested via <code>FetchPoV</code> message from backing (<code>pov_requester</code> module).</li>
</ul>
<p>The backing subsystem is responsible of making available data available in the local <code>Availability Store</code> upon
validation. This subsystem will serve any network requests by querying that store.</p>
<h2 id="protocol-7"><a class="header" href="#protocol-7">Protocol</a></h2>
<p>This subsystem does not handle any peer set messages, but the <code>pov_requester</code> does connect to validators of the same
backing group on the validation peer set, to ensure fast propagation of statements between those validators and for
ensuring already established connections for requesting <code>PoV</code>s. Other than that this subsystem drives request/response
protocols.</p>

<h3 id="pov-requester"><a class="header" href="#pov-requester">PoV Requester</a></h3>
<p>The PoV requester in the <code>pov_requester</code> module takes care of staying connected to validators of the current backing
group of this very validator on the <code>Validation</code> peer set and it will handle <code>FetchPoV</code> requests by issuing network
requests to those validators. It will check the hash of the received <code>PoV</code>, but will not do any further validation. That
needs to be done by the original <code>FetchPoV</code> sender (backing subsystem).</p>
<h3 id="chunk-requester"><a class="header" href="#chunk-requester">Chunk Requester</a></h3>
<p>After a candidate is backed, the availability of the PoV block must be confirmed by 2/3+ of all validators. The chunk
requester is responsible of making that availability a reality.</p>
<p>It does that by querying checking occupied cores for all active leaves. For each occupied core it will spawn a task
fetching the erasure chunk which has the <code>ValidatorIndex</code> of the node. For this an <code>ChunkFetchingRequest</code> is issued, via
Substrate's generic request/response protocol.</p>
<p>The spawned task will start trying to fetch the chunk from validators in responsible group of the occupied core, in a
random order. For ensuring that we use already open TCP connections wherever possible, the requester maintains a cache
and preserves that random order for the entire session.</p>
<p>Note however that, because not all validators in a group have to be actual backers, not all of them are required to have
the needed chunk. This in turn could lead to low throughput, as we have to wait for fetches to fail, before reaching a
validator finally having our chunk. We do rank back validators not delivering our chunk, but as backers could vary from
block to block on a perfectly legitimate basis, this is still not ideal. See issues
<a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/2509">2509</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/2512">2512</a> for more information.</p>
<p>The current implementation also only fetches chunks for occupied cores in blocks in active leaves. This means though, if
active leaves skips a block or we are particularly slow in fetching our chunk, we might not fetch our chunk if
availability reached 2/3 fast enough (slot becomes free). This is not desirable as we would like as many validators as
possible to have their chunk. See this <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/2513">issue</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="serving"><a class="header" href="#serving">Serving</a></h3>
<p>On the other side the subsystem will listen for incoming <code>ChunkFetchingRequest</code>s and <code>PoVFetchingRequest</code>s from the
network bridge and will respond to queries, by looking the requested chunks and <code>PoV</code>s up in the availability store,
this happens in the <code>responder</code> module.</p>
<p>We rely on the backing subsystem to make available data available locally in the <code>Availability Store</code> after it has
validated it.</p>

<p>This subsystem is the inverse of the <a href="node/availability/availability-distribution.html">Availability Distribution</a> subsystem: validators
will serve the availability chunks kept in the availability store to nodes who connect to them. And the subsystem will
also implement the other side: the logic for nodes to connect to validators, request availability pieces, and
reconstruct the <code>AvailableData</code>.</p>
<p>This version of the availability recovery subsystem is based off of direct connections to validators. In order to
recover any given <code>AvailableData</code>, we must recover at least <code>f + 1</code> pieces from validators of the session. Thus, we will
connect to and query randomly chosen validators until we have received <code>f + 1</code> pieces.</p>

<p>The approval subsystems implement the node-side of the <a href="node/approval/../../protocol-approval.html">Approval Protocol</a>.</p>
<p>We make a divide between the <a href="node/approval/approval-voting.html">assignment/voting logic</a> and the <a href="node/approval/approval-distribution.html">distribution
logic</a> that distributes assignment certifications and approval votes. The logic in the
assignment and voting also informs the GRANDPA voting rule on how to vote.</p>
<p>These subsystems are intended to flag issues and begin participating in live disputes. Dispute subsystems also track all
observed votes (backing, approval, and dispute-specific) by all validators on all candidates.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="approval-voting"><a class="header" href="#approval-voting">Approval Voting</a></h1>
<p>Reading the <a href="node/approval/../../protocol-approval.html">section on the approval protocol</a> will likely be necessary to understand the
aims of this subsystem.</p>
<p>Approval votes are split into two parts: Assignments and Approvals. Validators first broadcast their assignment to
indicate intent to check a candidate. Upon successfully checking, they broadcast an approval vote. If a validator
doesn't broadcast their approval vote shortly after issuing an assignment, this is an indication that they are being
prevented from recovering or validating the block data and that more validators should self-select to check the
candidate. This is known as a &quot;no-show&quot;.</p>
<p>The core of this subsystem is a Tick-based timer loop, where Ticks are 500ms. We also reason about time in terms of
<code>DelayTranche</code>s, which measure the number of ticks elapsed since a block was produced. We track metadata for all
un-finalized but included candidates. We compute our local assignments to check each candidate, as well as which
<code>DelayTranche</code> those assignments may be minimally triggered at. As the same candidate may appear in more than one block,
we must produce our potential assignments for each (Block, Candidate) pair. The timing loop is based on waiting for
assignments to become no-shows or waiting to broadcast and begin our own assignment to check.</p>
<p>Another main component of this subsystem is the logic for determining when a (Block, Candidate) pair has been approved
and when to broadcast and trigger our own assignment. Once a (Block, Candidate) pair has been approved, we mark a
corresponding bit in the <code>BlockEntry</code> that indicates the candidate has been approved under the block. When we trigger
our own assignment, we broadcast it via Approval Distribution, begin fetching the data from Availability Recovery, and
then pass it through to the Candidate Validation. Once these steps are successful, we issue our approval vote. If any of
these steps fail, we don't issue any vote and will &quot;no-show&quot; from the perspective of other validators in addition a
dispute is raised via the dispute-coordinator, by sending <code>IssueLocalStatement</code>.</p>
<p>Where this all fits into Polkadot is via block finality. Our goal is to not finalize any block containing a candidate
that is not approved. We provide a hook for a custom GRANDPA voting rule - GRANDPA makes requests of the form (target,
minimum) consisting of a target block (i.e. longest chain) that it would like to finalize, and a minimum block which,
due to the rules of GRANDPA, must be voted on. The minimum is typically the last finalized block, but may be beyond it,
in the case of having a last-round-estimate beyond the last finalized. Thus, our goal is to inform GRANDPA of some block
between target and minimum which we believe can be finalized safely. We do this by iterating backwards from the target
to the minimum and finding the longest continuous chain from minimum where all candidates included by those blocks have
been approved.</p>

<p>The approval voting subsystem is responsible for casting votes and determining approval of candidates and as a result,
blocks.</p>
<p>This subsystem wraps a database which is used to store metadata about unfinalized blocks and the candidates within them.
Candidates may appear in multiple blocks, and assignment criteria are chosen differently based on the hash of the block
they appear in.</p>
<h2 id="database-schema"><a class="header" href="#database-schema">Database Schema</a></h2>
<p>The database schema is designed with the following goals in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>To provide an easy index from unfinalized blocks to candidates</li>
<li>To provide a lookup from candidate hash to approval status</li>
<li>To be easy to clear on start-up. What has happened while we were offline is unimportant.</li>

<p>On start-up, we clear everything currently stored by the database. This is done by loading the <code>StoredBlockRange</code>,
iterating through each block number, iterating through each block hash, and iterating through each candidate referenced
by each block. Although this is <code>O(o*n*p)</code>, we don't expect to have more than a few unfinalized blocks at any time and
in extreme cases, a few thousand. The clearing operation should be relatively fast as a result.</p>

referenced by them up to and including <code>b</code>. Lastly, we prune out all descendants of <code>h</code> transitively: when we remove a

<p>On receiving an <code>OverseerSignal::ActiveLeavesUpdate(update)</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We determine the set of new blocks that were not in our previous view. This is done by querying the ancestry of all
new items in the view and contrasting against the stored <code>BlockNumber</code>s. Typically, there will be only one new
block. We fetch the headers and information on these blocks from the <code>ChainApi</code> subsystem. Stale leaves in the
update can be ignored.</li>
<li>We update the <code>StoredBlockRange</code> and the <code>BlockNumber</code> maps.</li>
<li>We use the <code>RuntimeApiSubsystem</code> to determine information about these blocks. It is generally safe to assume that
runtime state is available for recent, unfinalized blocks. In the case that it isn't, it means that we are catching
up to the head of the chain and needn't worry about assignments to those blocks anyway, as the security assumption
of the protocol tolerates nodes being temporarily offline or out-of-date.
<ul>
<li>We fetch the set of candidates included by each block by dispatching a <code>RuntimeApiRequest::CandidateEvents</code> and
checking the <code>CandidateIncluded</code> events.</li>
<li>We fetch the session of the block by dispatching a <code>session_index_for_child</code> request with the parent-hash of the
block.</li>
<li>If the <code>session index - APPROVAL_SESSIONS &gt; state.earliest_session</code>, then bump <code>state.earliest_sessions</code> to that
amount and prune earlier sessions.</li>
<li>If the session isn't in our <code>state.session_info</code>, load the session info for it and for all sessions since the
earliest-session, including the earliest-session, if that is missing. And it can be, just after pruning, if we've
done a big jump forward, as is the case when we've just finished chain synchronization.</li>
<li>If any of the runtime API calls fail, we just warn and skip the block.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We use the <code>RuntimeApiSubsystem</code> to determine the set of candidates included in these blocks and use BABE logic to
determine the slot number and VRF of the blocks.</li>
<li>We also note how late we appear to have received the block. We create a <code>BlockEntry</code> for each block and a
<code>CandidateEntry</code> for each candidate obtained from <code>CandidateIncluded</code> events after making a
<code>RuntimeApiRequest::CandidateEvents</code> request.</li>
<li>For each candidate, if the amount of needed approvals is more than the validators remaining after the backing group
of the candidate is subtracted, then the candidate is insta-approved as approval would be impossible otherwise. If
all candidates in the block are insta-approved, or there are no candidates in the block, then the block is
insta-approved. If the block is insta-approved, a <a href="node/approval/../../types/overseer-protocol.html#chainselectionmessage"><code>ChainSelectionMessage::Approved</code></a> should be sent for the
block.</li>
<li>Ensure that the <code>CandidateEntry</code> contains a <code>block_assignments</code> entry for the block, with the correct backing group

<ul>
<li>Load the <code>BlockEntry</code> for the relay-parent referenced by the message. If there is none, return
<code>AssignmentCheckResult::Bad</code>.</li>
<li>Fetch the <code>SessionInfo</code> for the session of the block</li>
<li>Determine the assignment key of the validator based on that.</li>
<li>Determine the claimed core index by looking up the candidate with given index in <code>block_entry.candidates</code>. Return

<li>Check the assignment cert
<ul>
<li>If the cert kind is <code>RelayVRFModulo</code>, then the certificate is valid as long as <code>sample &lt; session_info.relay_vrf_samples</code> and the VRF is valid for the validator's key with the input
<code>block_entry.relay_vrf_story ++ sample.encode()</code> as described with <a href="node/approval/../../protocol-approval.html#assignment-criteria">the approvals protocol
section</a>. We set <code>core_index = vrf.make_bytes().to_u32() % session_info.n_cores</code>. If the <code>BlockEntry</code> causes inclusion of a candidate at <code>core_index</code>, then this is a valid
assignment for the candidate at <code>core_index</code> and has delay tranche 0. Otherwise, it can be ignored.</li>
<li>If the cert kind is <code>RelayVRFDelay</code>, then we check if the VRF is valid for the validator's key with the input
<code>block_entry.relay_vrf_story ++ cert.core_index.encode()</code> as described in <a href="node/approval/../../protocol-approval.html#assignment-criteria">the approvals protocol
section</a>. The cert can be ignored if the block did not cause
inclusion of a candidate on that core index. Otherwise, this is a valid assignment for the included candidate. The
delay tranche for the assignment is determined by reducing <code>(vrf.make_bytes().to_u64() % (session_info.n_delay_tranches + session_info.zeroth_delay_tranche_width)).saturating_sub(session_info.zeroth_delay_tranche_width)</code>.</li>

<p>This logic is for inspecting an approval entry that tracks the assignments received, along with information on which
assignments have corresponding approval votes. Inspection also involves the current time and expected requirements and
is used to help the higher-level code determine the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether to broadcast the local assignment</li>
<li>Whether to check that the candidate entry has been completely approved.</li>
<li>If the candidate is waiting on approval, when to schedule the next wakeup of the <code>(candidate, block)</code> pair at a
point where the state machine could be advanced.</li>
</ul>
<p>These routines are pure functions which only depend on the environmental state. The expectation is that this
determination is re-run every time we attempt to update an approval entry: either when we trigger a wakeup to advance
the state machine based on a no-show or our own broadcast, or when we receive further assignments or approvals from the
network.</p>
<p>Thus it may be that at some point in time, we consider that tranches 0..X is required to be considered, but as we
receive more information, we might require fewer tranches. Or votes that we perceived to be missing and require
replacement are filled in and change our view.</p>

<p><strong>Clock-drift and Tranche-taking</strong></p>
<p>Our vote-counting procedure depends heavily on how we interpret time based on the presence of no-shows - assignments
which have no corresponding approval after some time.</p>
<p>We have this is because of how we handle no-shows: we keep track of the depth of no-shows we are covering.</p>
<p>As an example: there may be initial no-shows in tranche 0. It'll take <code>no_show_duration</code> ticks before those are
considered no-shows. Then, we don't want to immediately take <code>no_show_duration</code> more tranches. Instead, we want to take
one tranche for each uncovered no-show. However, as we take those tranches, there may be further no-shows. Since these
depth-1 no-shows should have only been triggered after the depth-0 no-shows were already known to be no-shows, we need
to discount the local clock by <code>no_show_duration</code> to  see whether these should be considered no-shows or not. There may
be malicious parties who broadcast their assignment earlier than they were meant to, who shouldn't be counted as instant
no-shows. We continue onwards to cover all depth-1 no-shows which may lead to depth-2 no-shows and so on.</p>
<p>Likewise, when considering how many tranches to take, the no-show depth should be used to apply a depth-discount or
clock drift to the <code>tranche_now</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Start with <code>depth = 0</code>.</li>
<li>Set a clock drift of <code>depth * no_show_duration</code></li>
<li>Take tranches up to <code>tranche_now - clock_drift</code> until all needed assignments are met.</li>
<li>Keep track of the <code>next_no_show</code> according to the clock drift, as we go.</li>
<li>Keep track of the <code>last_assignment_tick</code> as we go.</li>
<li>If running out of tranches before then, return <code>Pending { considered, next_no_show, maximum_broadcast, clock_drift }</code></li>
<li>If there are no no-shows, return <code>Exact { needed, tolerated_missing, next_no_show, last_assignment_tick }</code></li>
<li><code>maximum_broadcast</code> is either <code>DelayTranche::max_value()</code> at tranche 0 or otherwise by the last considered tranche +
the number of uncovered no-shows at this point.</li>
<li>If there are no-shows, return to the beginning, incrementing <code>depth</code> and attempting to cover the number of no-shows.
Each no-show must be covered by a non-empty tranche, which are tranches that have at least one assignment. Each
non-empty tranche covers exactly one no-show.</li>
<li>If at any point, it seems that all validators are required, do an early return with <code>RequiredTranches::All</code> which
indicates that everyone should broadcast.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="check-approval"><a class="header" href="#check-approval">Check Approval</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Check whether a candidate is approved under a particular block.</li>
<li>Requires <code>(block_entry, candidate_entry, approval_entry, n_tranches)</code></li>
<li>If we have <code>3 * n_approvals &gt; n_validators</code>, return true. This is because any set with f+1 validators must have at
least one honest validator, who has approved the candidate.</li>
<li>If <code>n_tranches</code> is <code>RequiredTranches::Pending</code>, return false</li>
<li>If <code>n_tranches</code> is <code>RequiredTranches::All</code>, return false.</li>
<li>If <code>n_tranches</code> is <code>RequiredTranches::Exact { tranche, tolerated_missing, latest_assignment_tick, .. }</code>, then we
return whether all assigned validators up to <code>tranche</code> less <code>tolerated_missing</code> have approved and
<code>latest_assignment_tick + APPROVAL_DELAY &gt;= tick_now</code>.
<ul>
<li>e.g. if we had 5 tranches and 1 tolerated missing, we would accept only if all but 1 of assigned validators in
tranches 0..=5 have approved. In that example, we also accept all validators in tranches 0..=5 having approved,
but that would indicate that the <code>RequiredTranches</code> value was incorrectly constructed, so it is not realistic.
<code>tolerated_missing</code> actually represents covered no-shows. If there are more missing approvals than there are
tolerated missing, that indicates that there are some assignments which are not yet no-shows, but may become
no-shows, and we should wait for the validators to either approve or become no-shows.</li>
<li>e.g. If the above passes and the <code>latest_assignment_tick</code> was 5 and the current tick was 6, then we'd return
false.</li>

<p>A subsystem for the distribution of assignments and approvals for approval checks on candidates over the network.</p>
<p>The <a href="node/approval/approval-voting.html">Approval Voting</a> subsystem is responsible for active participation in a protocol designed to
select a sufficient number of validators to check each and every candidate which appears in the relay chain. Statements
of participation in this checking process are divided into two kinds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assignments</strong> indicate that validators have been selected to do checking</li>
<li><strong>Approvals</strong> indicate that validators have checked and found the candidate satisfactory.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="node/approval/approval-voting.html">Approval Voting</a> subsystem handles all the issuing and tallying of this protocol, but this
subsystem is responsible for the disbursal of statements among the validator-set.</p>
<p>The inclusion pipeline of candidates concludes after availability, and only after inclusion do candidates actually get
pushed into the approval checking pipeline. As such, this protocol deals with the candidates <em>made available by</em>
particular blocks, as opposed to the candidates which actually appear within those blocks, which are the candidates
<em>backed by</em> those blocks. Unless stated otherwise, whenever we reference a candidate partially by block hash, we are
referring to the set of candidates <em>made available by</em> those blocks.</p>
<p>We implement this protocol as a gossip protocol, and like other parachain-related gossip protocols our primary concerns
are about ensuring fast message propagation while maintaining an upper bound on the number of messages any given node
must store at any time.</p>
<p>Approval messages should always follow assignments, so we need to be able to discern two pieces of information based on
our <a href="node/approval/../../types/network.html#universal-types">View</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is a particular assignment relevant under a given <code>View</code>?</li>
<li>Is a particular approval relevant to any assignment in a set?</li>
</ol>
<p>For our own local view, these two queries  must not yield false negatives. When applied to our peers' views, it is
acceptable for them to yield false negatives. The reason for that is that our peers' views may be beyond ours, and we
are not capable of fully evaluating them. Once we have caught up, we can check again for false negatives to continue
distributing.</p>
<p>For assignments, what we need to be checking is whether we are aware of the (block, candidate) pair that the assignment
references. For approvals, we need to be aware of an assignment by the same validator which references the candidate
being approved.</p>
<p>However, awareness on its own of a (block, candidate) pair would imply that even ancient candidates all the way back to
the genesis are relevant. We are actually not interested in anything before finality.</p>
<p>We gossip assignments along a grid topology produced by the <a href="node/approval/../utility/gossip-support.html">Gossip Support Subsystem</a> and
also to a few random peers. The first time we accept an assignment or approval, regardless of the source, which
originates from a validator peer in a shared dimension of the grid, we propagate the message to validator peers in the
unshared dimension as well as a few random peers.</p>
<p>But, in case these mechanisms don't work on their own, we need to trade bandwidth for protocol liveness by introducing
aggression.</p>
<p>Aggression has 3 levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggression Level 0: The basic behaviors described above.</li>
<li>Aggression Level 1: The originator of a message sends to all peers. Other peers follow the rules above.</li>
<li>Aggression Level 2: All peers send all messages to all their row and column neighbors. This means that each validator
will, on average, receive each message approximately 2*sqrt(n) times.</li>
</ul>
<p>These aggression levels are chosen based on how long a block has taken to finalize: assignments and approvals related to
the unfinalized block will be propagated with more aggression. In particular, it's only the earliest unfinalized blocks
that aggression should be applied to, because descendants may be unfinalized only by virtue of being descendants.</p>

<p>If approval voting finds an invalid candidate, a dispute is raised. The disputes
subsystems are concerned with the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disputes can be raised</li>
<li>Disputes (votes) get propagated to all other validators</li>
<li>Votes get recorded as necessary</li>
<li>Nodes will participate in disputes in a sensible fashion</li>
<li>Finality is stopped while a candidate is being disputed on chain</li>
<li>Chains can be reverted in case a dispute concludes invalid</li>
<li>Votes are provided to the provisioner for importing on chain, in order for
slashing to work.</li>
</ol>
<p>The dispute-coordinator subsystem interfaces with the provisioner and chain
selection to make the bulk of this possible. <code>dispute-distribution</code> is concerned
with getting votes out to other validators and receiving them in a spam
resilient way.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dispute-coordinator"><a class="header" href="#dispute-coordinator">Dispute Coordinator</a></h1>
<p>The coordinator is the central subsystem of the node-side components which participate in disputes. It wraps a database,
which is used to track statements observed by <em>all</em> validators over some window of sessions. Votes older than this
session window are pruned.</p>
<p>In particular the dispute-coordinator is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring that the node is able to raise a dispute in case an invalid candidate is found during approval checking.</li>
<li>Ensuring that backing and approval votes will be recorded on chain. With these votes on chain we can be certain that
appropriate targets for slashing will be available for concluded disputes. Also, scraping these votes during a dispute
is necessary for critical spam prevention measures.</li>
<li>Ensuring backing votes will never get overridden by explicit votes.</li>
<li>Coordinating actual participation in a dispute, ensuring that the node participates in any justified dispute in a way
that ensures resolution of disputes on the network even in the case of many disputes raised (flood/DoS scenario).</li>
<li>Ensuring disputes resolve, even for candidates on abandoned forks as much as reasonably possible, to rule out &quot;free
tries&quot; and thus guarantee our gambler's ruin property.</li>
<li>Providing an API for chain selection, so we can prevent finalization of any chain which has included candidates for
which a dispute is either ongoing or concluded invalid and avoid building on chains with an included invalid
candidate.</li>
<li>Providing an API for retrieving (resolved) disputes, including all votes, both implicit (approval, backing) and
explicit dispute votes. So validators can get rewarded/slashed accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ensuring-that-disputes-can-be-raised"><a class="header" href="#ensuring-that-disputes-can-be-raised">Ensuring That Disputes Can Be Raised</a></h2>
<p>If a candidate turns out invalid in approval checking, the <code>approval-voting</code> subsystem will try to issue a dispute. For
this, it will send a message <code>DisputeCoordinatorMessage::IssueLocalStatement</code> to the dispute coordinator, indicating to
cast an explicit invalid vote. It is the responsibility of the dispute coordinator on reception of such a message to
create and sign that explicit invalid vote and trigger a dispute if none for that candidate is already ongoing.</p>
<p>In order to raise a dispute, a node has to be able to provide two opposing votes. Given that the reason of the backing
phase is to have validators with skin in the game, the opposing valid vote will very likely be a backing vote. It could
also be some already cast approval vote, but the significant point here is: As long as we have backing votes available,
any node will be able to raise a dispute.</p>
<p>Therefore a vital responsibility of the dispute coordinator is to make sure backing votes are available for all
candidates that might still get disputed. To accomplish this task in an efficient way the dispute-coordinator relies on
chain scraping. Whenever a candidate gets backed on chain, we record in chain storage the backing votes imported in that
block. This way, given the chain state for a given relay chain block, we can retrieve via a provided runtime API the
backing votes imported by that block. The dispute coordinator makes sure to query those votes for any non finalized
blocks: In case of missed blocks, it will do chain traversal as necessary.</p>
<p>Relying on chain scraping is very efficient for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Votes are already batched. We import all available backing votes for a candidate all at once. If instead we imported
votes from candidate-backing as they came along, we would import each vote individually which is inefficient in the
current dispute coordinator implementation (quadratic complexity).</li>
<li>We also import less votes in total, as we avoid importing statements for candidates that never got successfully
backed on any chain.</li>
</ol>
<p>It also is secure, because disputes are only ever raised in the approval voting phase. A node only starts the approval
process after it has seen a candidate included on some chain, for that to happen it must have been backed previously.
Therefore backing votes are available at that point in time. Signals are processed first, so even if a block is skipped
and we only start importing backing votes on the including block, we will have seen the backing votes by the time we
process messages from approval voting.</p>
<p>In summary, for making it possible for a dispute to be raised, recording of backing votes from chain is sufficient and
efficient. In particular there is no need to preemptively import approval votes, which has shown to be a very
inefficient process. (Quadratic complexity adds up, with 35 votes in total per candidate)</p>
<p>Approval votes are very relevant nonetheless as we are going to see in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="ensuring-approval-votes-will-be-recorded"><a class="header" href="#ensuring-approval-votes-will-be-recorded">Ensuring approval votes will be recorded</a></h2>
<h3 id="ensuring-recording"><a class="header" href="#ensuring-recording">Ensuring Recording</a></h3>
<p>Only votes recorded by the dispute coordinator will be considered for slashing.</p>
<p>While there is no need to record approval votes in the dispute coordinator preemptively, we make some effort to have any
in approval-voting received approval votes recorded when a dispute actually happens:</p>
<p>This is not required for concluding the dispute, as nodes send their own vote anyway (either explicit valid or their
existing approval-vote). What nodes can do though, is participating in approval-voting, casting a vote, but later when a
dispute is raised reconsider their vote and send an explicit invalid vote. If they managed to only have that one
recorded, then they could avoid a slash.</p>
<p>This is not a problem for our basic security assumptions: The backers are the ones to be supposed to have skin in the
game, so we are not too woried about colluding approval voters getting away slash free as the gambler's ruin property is
maintained anyway. There is however a separate problem, from colluding approval-voters, that is &quot;lazy&quot; approval voters.
If it were easy and reliable for approval-voters to reconsider their vote, in case of an actual dispute, then they don't
have a direct incentive (apart from playing a part in securing the network) to properly run the validation function at
all - they could just always vote &quot;valid&quot; totally risk free. (While they would always risk a slash by voting invalid.)</p>
<p>So we do want to fetch approval votes from approval-voting. Importing votes is most efficient when batched. At the same
time approval voting and disputes are running concurrently so approval votes are expected to trickle in still, when a
dispute is already ongoing.</p>
<p>Hence, we have the following requirements for importing approval votes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Only import them when there is a dispute, because otherwise we are wasting lots of resources <em>always</em> for the
exceptional case of a dispute.</li>
<li>Import votes batched when possible, to avoid quadratic import complexity.</li>
<li>Take into account that approval voting is still ongoing, while a dispute is already running.</li>
</ol>
<p>With a design where approval voting sends votes to the dispute-coordinator by itself, we would need to make approval
voting aware of ongoing disputes and once it is aware it could start sending all already existing votes batched and
trickling in votes as they come. The problem with this is, that it adds some unnecessary complexity to approval-voting
and also we might still import most of the votes unbatched one-by-one, depending on what point in time the dispute was
raised.</p>
<p>Instead of the dispute coordinator informing approval-voting of an ongoing dispute for it to begin forwarding votes to
the dispute coordinator, it makes more sense for the dispute-coordinator to just ask approval-voting for votes of
candidates in dispute. This way, the dispute coordinator can also pick the best time for maximizing the number of votes
in the batch.</p>
<p>Now the question remains, when should the dispute coordinator ask approval-voting for votes?</p>
<p>In fact for slashing it is only relevant to have them once the dispute concluded, so we can query approval voting the
moment the dispute concludes! Two concerns that come to mind, are easily addressed:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Timing: We would like to rely as little as possible on implementation details of approval voting. In particular, if
the dispute is ongoing for a long time, do we have any guarantees that approval votes are kept around long enough by
approval voting? Will approval votes still be present by the time the dispute concludes in all cases? The answer is
nuanced, but in general we cannot rely on it. The problem is first, that finalization and approval-voting is an
off-chain process so there is no global consensus: As soon as at least f+1 honest (f=n/3, where n is the number of
validators/nodes) nodes have seen the dispute conclude, finalization will take place and approval votes will be
cleared. This would still be fine, if we had some guarantees that those honest nodes will be able to include those
votes in a block. This guarantee does not exist unfortunately, we will discuss the problem and solutions in more
detail [below][#Ensuring Chain Import].</p>
<p>The second problem is that approval-voting will abandon votes as soon as a chain can no longer be finalized (some
other/better fork already has been). This second problem can somehow be mitigated by also importing votes as soon as
a dispute is detected, but not fully resolved. It is still inherently racy. The good thing is, this should be good
enough: We are worried about lazy approval checkers, the system does not need to be perfect. It should be enough if
there is some risk of getting caught.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are not worried about the dispute not concluding, as nodes will always send their own vote, regardless of it being
an explicit or an already existing approval-vote.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Conclusion: As long as we make sure, if our own approval vote gets imported (which would prevent dispute participation)
to also distribute it via dispute-distribution, disputes can conclude. To mitigate raciness with approval-voting
deleting votes we will import approval votes twice during a dispute: Once when it is raised, to make as sure as possible
to see approval votes also for abandoned forks and second when the dispute concludes, to maximize the amount of
potentially malicious approval votes to be recorded. The raciness obviously is not fully resolved by this, but this is
fine as argued above.</p>
<p>Ensuring vote import on chain is covered in the next section.</p>
<p>What we don't care about is that honest approval-voters will likely validate twice, once in approval voting and once via
dispute-participation. Avoiding that does not really seem worthwhile though, as disputes are for one exceptional, so a
little wasted effort won't affect everyday performance - second, even with eager importing of approval votes, those
doubled work is still present as disputes and approvals are racing. Every time participation is faster than approval, a
node would do double work.</p>
<h3 id="ensuring-chain-import"><a class="header" href="#ensuring-chain-import">Ensuring Chain Import</a></h3>
<p>While in the previous section we discussed means for nodes to ensure relevant votes are recorded so lazy approval
checkers get slashed properly, it is crucial to also discuss the actual chain import. Only if we guarantee that recorded
votes will get imported on chain (on all potential chains really) we will succeed in executing slashes. Particularly we
need to make sure backing votes end up on chain consistently.</p>
<p>Dispute distribution will make sure all explicit dispute votes get distributed among nodes which includes current block
producers (current authority set) which is an important property: If the dispute carries on across an era change, we
need to ensure that the new validator set will learn about any disputes and their votes, so they can put that
information on chain. Dispute-distribution luckily has this property and always sends votes to the current authority
set. The issue is, for dispute-distribution, nodes send only their own explicit (or in some cases their approval vote)
in addition to some opposing vote. This guarantees that at least some backing or approval vote will be present at the
block producer, but we don't have a 100% guarantee to have votes for all backers, even less for approval checkers.</p>
<p>Reason for backing votes: While backing votes will be present on at least some chain, that does not mean that any such
chain is still considered for block production in the current set - they might only exist on an already abandoned fork.
This means a block producer that just joined the set, might not have seen any of them.</p>
<p>For approvals it is even more tricky and less necessary: Approval voting together with finalization is a completely
off-chain process therefore those protocols don't care about block production at all. Approval votes only have a
guarantee of being propagated between the nodes that are responsible for finalizing the concerned blocks. This implies
that on an era change the current authority set, will not necessarily get informed about any approval votes for the
previous era. Hence even if all validators of the previous era successfully recorded all approval votes in the dispute
coordinator, they won't get a chance to put them on chain, hence they won't be considered for slashing.</p>
<p>It is important to note, that the essential properties of the system still hold: Dispute-distribution will distribute at
<em>least one</em> &quot;valid&quot; vote to the current authority set, hence at least one node will get slashed in case of outcome
&quot;invalid&quot;. Also in reality the validator set is rarely exchanged 100%, therefore in practice some validators in the
current authority set will overlap with the ones in the previous set and will be able to record votes on chain.</p>
<p>Still, for maximum accountability we need to make sure a previous authority set can communicate votes to the next one,
regardless of any chain: This is yet to be implemented see section &quot;Resiliency&quot; in dispute-distribution and
<a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/3398">this</a> ticket.</p>
<h2 id="coordinating-actual-dispute-participation"><a class="header" href="#coordinating-actual-dispute-participation">Coordinating Actual Dispute Participation</a></h2>
<p>Once the dispute coordinator learns about a dispute, it is its responsibility to make sure the local node participates
in that dispute.</p>
<p>The dispute coordinator learns about a dispute by importing votes from either chain scraping or from
dispute-distribution. If it finds opposing votes (always the case when coming from dispute-distribution), it records the
presence of a dispute. Then, in case it does not find any local vote for that dispute already, it needs to trigger
participation in the dispute (see previous section for considerations when the found local vote is an approval vote).</p>
<p>Participation means, recovering availability and re-evaluating the POV. The result of that validation (either valid or
invalid) will be the node's vote on that dispute: Either explicit &quot;invalid&quot; or &quot;valid&quot;. The dispute coordinator will
inform <code>dispute-distribution</code> about our vote and <code>dispute-distribution</code> will make sure that our vote gets distributed to
all other validators.</p>
<p>Nothing ever is that easy though. We can not blindly import anything that comes along and trigger participation no
matter what.</p>
<h3 id="spam-considerations"><a class="header" href="#spam-considerations">Spam Considerations</a></h3>
<p>In Polkadot's security model, it is important that attempts to attack the system result in a slash of the offenders.
Therefore we need to make sure that this slash is actually happening. Attackers could try to prevent the slashing from
taking place, by overwhelming validators with disputes in such a way that no single dispute ever concludes, because
nodes are busy processing newly incoming ones. Other attacks are imaginable as well, like raising disputes for
candidates that don't exist, just filling up everyone's disk slowly or worse making nodes try to participate, which will
result in lots of network requests for recovering availability.</p>
<p>The last point brings up a significant consideration in general: Disputes are about escalation: Every node will suddenly
want to check, instead of only a few. A single message will trigger the whole network to start significant amount of
work and will cause lots of network traffic and messages. Hence the dispute system is very susceptible to being a brutal
amplifier for DoS attacks, resulting in DoS attacks to become very easy and cheap, if we are not careful.</p>
<p>One counter measure we are taking is making raising of disputes a costly thing: If you raise a dispute, because you
claim a candidate is invalid, although it is in fact valid - you will get slashed, hence you pay for consuming those
resources. The issue is: This only works if the dispute concerns a candidate that actually exists!</p>
<p>If a node raises a dispute for a candidate that never got included (became available) on any chain, then the dispute can
never conclude, hence nobody gets slashed. It makes sense to point out that this is less bad than it might sound at
first, as trying to participate in a dispute for a non existing candidate is &quot;relatively&quot; cheap. Each node will send out
a few hundred tiny request messages for availability chunks, which all will end up in a tiny response &quot;NoSuchChunk&quot; and
then no participation will actually happen as there is nothing to participate. Malicious nodes could provide chunks,
which would make things more costly, but at the full expense of the attackers bandwidth - no amplification here. I am
bringing that up for completeness only: Triggering a thousand nodes to send out a thousand tiny network messages by just
sending out a single garbage message, is still a significant amplification and is nothing to ignore - this could
absolutely be used to cause harm!</p>
<h3 id="participation"><a class="header" href="#participation">Participation</a></h3>
<p>As explained, just blindly participating in any &quot;dispute&quot; that comes along is not a good idea. First we would like to
make sure the dispute is actually genuine, to prevent cheap DoS attacks. Secondly, in case of genuine disputes, we would
like to conclude one after the other, in contrast to processing all at the same time, slowing down progress on all of
them, bringing individual processing to a complete halt in the worst case (nodes get overwhelmed at some stage in the
pipeline).</p>
<p>To ensure to only spend significant work on genuine disputes, we only trigger participation at all on any <em>vote import</em>
if any of the following holds true:</p>
<ul>
<li>We saw the disputed candidate included in some not yet finalized block on at least one fork of the chain.</li>
<li>We have seen the disputed candidate backed in some not yet finalized block on at least one fork of the chain. This
ensures the candidate is at least not completely made up and there has been some effort already flown into that
candidate. Generally speaking a dispute shouldn't be raised for a candidate which is backed but is not yet included.
Disputes are raised during approval checking. We participate on such disputes as a precaution - maybe we haven't seen
the <code>CandidateIncluded</code> event yet?</li>
<li>The dispute is already confirmed: Meaning that 1/3+1 nodes already participated, as this suggests in our threat model
that there was at least one honest node that already voted, so the dispute must be genuine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: A node might be out of sync with the chain and we might only learn about a block, including a candidate, after we
learned about the dispute. This means, we have to re-evaluate participation decisions on block import!</p>
<p>With this, nodes won't waste significant resources on completely made up candidates. The next step is to process dispute
participation in a (globally) ordered fashion. Meaning a majority of validators should arrive at at least roughly at the
same ordering of participation, for disputes to get resolved one after another. This order is only relevant if there are
lots of disputes, so we obviously only need to worry about order if participations start queuing up.</p>
<p>We treat participation for candidates that we have seen included with priority and put them on a priority queue which
sorts participation based on the block number of the relay parent of the candidate and for candidates with the same
relay parent height further by the <code>CandidateHash</code>. This ordering is globally unique and also prioritizes older
candidates.</p>
<p>The latter property makes sense, because if an older candidate turns out invalid, we can roll back the full chain at
once. If we resolved earlier disputes first and they turned out invalid as well, we might need to roll back a couple of
times instead of just once to the oldest offender. This is obviously a good idea, in particular it makes it impossible
for an attacker to prevent rolling back a very old candidate, by keeping raising disputes for newer candidates.</p>
<p>For candidates we have not seen included, but we know are backed (thanks to chain scraping) or we have seen a dispute
with 1/3+1 participation (confirmed dispute) on them - we put participation on a best-effort queue. It has got the same
ordering as the priority one - by block heights of the relay parent, older blocks are with priority. There is a
possibility not to be able to obtain the block number of the parent when we are inserting the dispute in the queue. To
account for races, we will promote any existing participation request to the priority queue once we learn about an
including block. NOTE: this is still work in progress and is tracked by <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/5875">this
issue</a>.</p>
<h3 id="abandoned-forks"><a class="header" href="#abandoned-forks">Abandoned Forks</a></h3>
<p>Finalization: As mentioned we care about included and backed candidates on any non-finalized chain, given that any
disputed chain will not get finalized, we don't need to care about finalized blocks, but what about forks that fall
behind the finalized chain in terms of block number? For those we would still like to be able to participate in any
raised disputes, otherwise attackers might be able to avoid a slash if they manage to create a better fork after they
learned about the approval checkers. Therefore we do care about those forks even after they have fallen behind the
finalized chain.</p>
<p>For simplicity we also care about the actual finalized chain (not just forks) up to a certain depth. We do have to limit
the depth, because otherwise we open a DoS vector again. The depth (into the finalized chain) should be oriented on the
approval-voting execution timeout, in particular it should be significantly larger. Otherwise by the time the execution
is allowed to finish, we already dropped information about those candidates and the dispute could not conclude.</p>
<h2 id="import"><a class="header" href="#import">Import</a></h2>
<h3 id="spam-considerations-1"><a class="header" href="#spam-considerations-1">Spam Considerations</a></h3>
<p>In the last section we looked at how to treat queuing participations to handle heavy dispute load well. This already
ensures, that honest nodes won't amplify cheap DoS attacks. There is one minor issue remaining: Even if we delay
participation until we have some confirmation of the authenticity of the dispute, we should also not blindly import all
votes arriving into the database as this might be used to just slowly fill up disk space, until the node is no longer
functional. This leads to our last protection mechanism at the dispute coordinator level (dispute-distribution also has
its own), which is spam slots. For each import containing an invalid vote, where we don't know whether it might be spam
or not we increment a counter for each signing participant of explicit <code>invalid</code> votes.</p>
<p>What votes do we treat as a potential spam? A vote will increase a spam slot if and only if all of the following
conditions are satisfied:</p>
<ul>
<li>the candidate under dispute was not seen included nor backed on any chain</li>
<li>the dispute is not confirmed</li>
<li>we haven't cast a vote for the dispute</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever any vote on a dispute is imported these conditions are checked. If the dispute is found not to be potential
spam, then spam slots for the disputed candidate hash are cleared. This decrements the spam count for every validator
which had voted invalid.</p>
<p>To keep spam slots from filling up unnecessarily we want to clear spam slots whenever a candidate is seen to be backed
or included. Fortunately this behavior is achieved by clearing slots on vote import as described above. Because on chain
backing votes are processed when a block backing the disputed candidate is discovered, spam slots are cleared for every
backed candidate. Included candidates have also been seen as backed on the same fork, so decrementing spam slots is
handled in that case as well.</p>
<p>The reason this works is because we only need to worry about actual dispute votes. Import of backing votes are already
rate limited and concern only real candidates. For approval votes a similar argument holds (if they come from
approval-voting), but we also don't import them until a dispute already concluded. For actual dispute votes we need two
opposing votes, so there must be an explicit <code>invalid</code> vote in the import. Only a third of the validators can be
malicious, so spam disk usage is limited to <code>2*vote_size*n/3*NUM_SPAM_SLOTS</code>, with <code>n</code> being the number of validators.</p>
<h3 id="backing-votes"><a class="header" href="#backing-votes">Backing Votes</a></h3>
<p>Backing votes are in some way special. For starters they are the only valid votes that are guaranteed to exist for any
valid dispute to be raised. Second they are the only votes that commit to a shorter execution timeout
<code>BACKING_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT</code>, compared to a more lenient timeout used in approval voting. To account properly for
execution time variance across machines, slashing might treat backing votes differently (more aggressively) than other
voting <code>valid</code> votes. Hence in import we shall never override a backing vote with another valid vote. They can not be
assumed to be interchangeable.</p>
<h2 id="attacks--considerations"><a class="header" href="#attacks--considerations">Attacks &amp; Considerations</a></h2>
<p>The following attacks on the priority queue and best-effort queues are considered in above design.</p>
<h3 id="priority-queue"><a class="header" href="#priority-queue">Priority Queue</a></h3>
<p>On the priority queue, we will only queue participations for candidates we have seen included on any chain. Any attack
attempt would start with a candidate included on some chain, but an attacker could try to only reveal the including
relay chain blocks to just some honest validators and stop as soon as it learns that some honest validator would have a
relevant approval assignment.</p>
<p>Without revealing the including block to any honest validator, we don't really have an attack yet. Once the block is
revealed though, the above is actually very hard. Each honest validator will re-distribute the block it just learned
about. This means an attacker would need to pull of a targeted DoS attack, which allows the validator to send its
assignment, but prevents it from forwarding and sharing the relay chain block.</p>
<p>This sounds already hard enough, provided that we also start participation if we learned about an including block after
the dispute has been raised already (we need to update participation queues on new leaves), but to be even safer we
choose to have an additional best-effort queue.</p>
<h3 id="best-effort-queue"><a class="header" href="#best-effort-queue">Best-Effort Queue</a></h3>
<p>While attacking the priority queue is already pretty hard, attacking the best-effort queue is even harder. For a
candidate to be a threat, it has to be included on some chain. For it to be included, it has to have been backed before
and at least n/3 honest nodes must have seen that block, so availability (inclusion) can be reached. Making a full third
of the nodes not further propagate a block, while at the same time allowing them to fetch chunks, sign and distribute
bitfields seems almost infeasible and even if accomplished, those nodes would be enough to confirm a dispute and we have
not even touched the above fact that in addition, for an attack, the following including block must be shared with
honest validators as well.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that a successful attack on the priority queue as outlined above is already outside of our threat
model, as it assumes n/3 malicious nodes + additionally malfunctioning/DoSed nodes. Even more so for attacks on the
best-effort queue, as our threat model only allows for n/3 malicious <em>or</em> malfunctioning nodes in total. It would
therefore be a valid decision to ditch the best-effort queue, if it proves to become a burden or creates other issues.</p>
<p>One issue we should not be worried about though is spam. For abusing best-effort for spam, the following scenario would
be necessary:</p>
<p>An attacker controls a backing group: The attacker can then have candidates backed and choose to not provide chunks.
This should come at a cost to miss out on rewards for backing, so is not free. At the same time it is rate limited, as a
backing group can only back so many candidates legitimately. (~ 1 per slot):</p>
<ol>
<li>They have to wait until a malicious actor becomes block producer (for causing additional forks via equivocation for
example).</li>
<li>Forks are possible, but if caused by equivocation also not free.</li>
<li>For each fork the attacker has to wait until the candidate times out, for backing another one.</li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming there can only be a handful of forks, 2) together with 3) the candidate timeout restriction, frequency should
indeed be in the ballpark of once per slot. Scaling linearly in the number of controlled backing groups, so two groups
would mean 2 backings per slot, ...</p>
<p>So by this reasoning an attacker could only do very limited harm and at the same time will have to pay some price for it
(it will miss out on rewards). Overall the work done by the network might even be in the same ballpark as if actors just
behaved honestly:</p>
<ol>
<li>Validators would have fetched chunks</li>
<li>Approval checkers would have done approval checks</li>
</ol>
<p>While because of the attack (backing, not providing chunks and afterwards disputing the candidate), the work for 1000
validators would be:</p>
<p>All validators sending out ~ 1000 tiny requests over already established connections, with also tiny (byte) responses.</p>
<p>This means around a million requests, while in the honest case it would be ~ 10000 (30 approval checkers x330) - where
each request triggers a response in the range of kilobytes. Hence network load alone will likely be higher in the honest
case than in the DoS attempt case, which would mean the DoS attempt actually reduces load, while also costing rewards.</p>
<p>In the worst case this can happen multiple times, as we would retry that on every vote import. The effect would still be
in the same ballpark as honest behavior though and can also be mitigated by chilling repeated availability recovery
requests for example.</p>
<h2 id="out-of-scope"><a class="header" href="#out-of-scope">Out of Scope</a></h2>
<h3 id="no-disputes-for-non-included-candidates"><a class="header" href="#no-disputes-for-non-included-candidates">No Disputes for Non Included Candidates</a></h3>
<p>We only ever care about disputes for candidates that have been included on at least some chain (became available). This
is because the availability system was designed for precisely that: Only with inclusion (availability) we have
guarantees about the candidate to actually be available. Because only then we have guarantees that malicious backers can
be reliably checked and slashed. Also, by design non included candidates do not pose any threat to the system.</p>
<p>One could think of an (additional) dispute system to make it possible to dispute any candidate that has been proposed by
a validator, no matter whether it got successfully included or even backed. Unfortunately, it would be very brittle (no
availability) and also spam protection would be way harder than for the disputes handled by the dispute-coordinator. In
fact, all the spam handling strategies described above would simply be unavailable.</p>
<p>It is worth thinking about who could actually raise such disputes anyway: Approval checkers certainly not, as they will
only ever check once availability succeeded. The only other nodes that meaningfully could/would are honest backing nodes
or collators. For collators spam considerations would be even worse as there can be an unlimited number of them and we
can not charge them for spam, so trying to handle disputes raised by collators would be even more complex. For honest
backers: It actually makes more sense for them to wait until availability is reached as well, as only then they have
guarantees that other nodes will be able to check. If they disputed before, all nodes would need to recover the data
from them, so they would be an easy DoS target.</p>
<p>In summary: The availability system was designed for raising disputes in a meaningful and secure way after availability
was reached. Trying to raise disputes before does not meaningfully contribute to the systems security/might even weaken
it as attackers are warned before availability is reached, while at the same time adding significant amount of
complexity. We therefore punt on such disputes and concentrate on disputes the system was designed to handle.</p>
<h3 id="no-disputes-for-already-finalized-blocks"><a class="header" href="#no-disputes-for-already-finalized-blocks">No Disputes for Already Finalized Blocks</a></h3>
<p>Note that by above rules in the <code>Participation</code> section, we will not participate in disputes concerning a candidate in
an already finalized block. This is because, disputing an already finalized block is simply too late and therefore of
little value. Once finalized, bridges have already processed the block for example, so we have to assume the damage is
already done. Governance has to step in and fix what can be fixed.</p>
<p>Making disputes for already finalized blocks possible would only provide two features:</p>
<ol>
<li>We can at least still slash attackers.</li>
<li>We can freeze the chain to some governance only mode, in an attempt to minimize potential harm done.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both seem kind of worthwhile, although as argued above, it is likely that there is not too much that can be done in 2
and we would likely only ending up DoSing the whole system without much we can do. 1 can also be achieved via governance
mechanisms.</p>
<p>In any case, our focus should be making as sure as reasonably possible that any potentially invalid block does not get
finalized in the first place. Not allowing disputing already finalized blocks actually helps a great deal with this goal
as it massively reduces the amount of candidates that can be disputed.</p>
<p>This makes attempts to overwhelm the system with disputes significantly harder and counter measures way easier. We can
limit inclusion for example (as suggested <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/5898">here</a> in case of high
dispute load. Another measure we have at our disposal is that on finality lag block production will slow down,
implicitly reducing the rate of new candidates that can be disputed. Hence, the cutting-off of the unlimited candidate
supply of already finalized blocks, guarantees the necessary DoS protection and ensures we can have measures in place to
keep up with processing of disputes.</p>
<p>If we allowed participation for disputes for already finalized candidates, the above spam protection mechanisms would be
insufficient/relying 100% on full and quick disabling of spamming validators.</p>

<p>A dispute is initiated once a node sends the first <code>DisputeRequest</code> wire message,
which must contain an &quot;invalid&quot; vote and a &quot;valid&quot; vote.</p>
<p>The dispute distribution subsystem can get instructed to send that message out to
all concerned validators by means of a <code>DisputeDistributionMessage::SendDispute</code>
message. That message must contain an invalid vote from the local node and some
valid one, e.g. a backing statement.</p>
<p>We include a valid vote as well, so any node regardless of whether it is synced
with the chain or not or has seen backing/approval vote can see that there are
conflicting votes available, hence we have a valid dispute. Nodes will still
need to check whether the disputing votes are somewhat current and not some
stale ones.</p>

coordinator will send a <code>DisputeDistributionMessage::SendDispute</code> message to dispute
distribution. From here, everything is the same as for starting a dispute,
except that if the local node deemed the candidate valid, the <code>SendDispute</code>
message will contain a valid vote signed by our node and will contain the
initially received <code>Invalid</code> vote.</p>
<p>Note, that we rely on <code>dispute-coordinator</code> to check validity of a dispute for spam
protection (see below).</p>
<h2 id="sending-of-messages"><a class="header" href="#sending-of-messages">Sending of messages</a></h2>
<p>Starting and participating in a dispute are pretty similar from the perspective
of dispute distribution. Once we receive a <code>SendDispute</code> message, we try to make
sure to get the data out. We keep track of all the parachain validators that
should see the message, which are all the parachain validators of the session
where the dispute happened as they will want to participate in the dispute.  In
addition we also need to get the votes out to all authorities of the current
session (which might be the same or not and may change during the dispute).
Those authorities will not participate in the dispute, but need to see the
statements so they can include them in blocks.</p>
<h3 id="reliability"><a class="header" href="#reliability">Reliability</a></h3>
<p>We only consider a message transmitted, once we received a confirmation message.
If not, we will keep retrying getting that message out as long as the dispute is
deemed alive. To determine whether a dispute is still alive we will ask the
<code>dispute-coordinator</code> for a list of all still active disputes via a
<code>DisputeCoordinatorMessage::ActiveDisputes</code> message before each retry run. Once
a dispute is no longer live, we will clean up the state accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="order"><a class="header" href="#order">Order</a></h3>
<p>We assume <code>SendDispute</code> messages are coming in an order of importance, hence
<code>dispute-distribution</code> will make sure to send out network messages in the same
order, even on retry.</p>
<h3 id="rate-limit"><a class="header" href="#rate-limit">Rate Limit</a></h3>
<p>For spam protection (see below), we employ an artificial rate limiting on sending
out messages in order to not hit the rate limit at the receiving side, which
would result in our messages getting dropped and our reputation getting reduced.</p>
<h2 id="reception"><a class="header" href="#reception">Reception</a></h2>
<p>As we shall see the receiving side is mostly about handling spam and ensuring
the dispute-coordinator learns about disputes as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Goals for the receiving side:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get new disputes to the dispute-coordinator as fast as possible, so
prioritization can happen properly.</li>
<li>Batch votes per disputes as much as possible for good import performance.</li>
<li>Prevent malicious nodes exhausting node resources by sending lots of messages.</li>
<li>Prevent malicious nodes from sending so many messages/(fake) disputes,
preventing us from concluding good ones.</li>
<li>Limit ability of malicious nodes of delaying the vote import due to batching
logic.</li>
</ol>
<p>Goal 1 and 2 seem to be conflicting, but an easy compromise is possible: When
learning about a new dispute, we will import the vote immediately, making the
dispute coordinator aware and also getting immediate feedback on the validity.
Then if valid we can batch further incoming votes, with less time constraints as
the dispute-coordinator already knows about the dispute.</p>
<p>Goal 3 and 4 are obviously very related and both can easily be solved via rate
limiting as we shall see below. Rate limits should already be implemented at the
Substrate level, but <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/7750">are not</a>
at the time of writing. But even if they were, the enforced Substrate limits would
likely not be configurable and thus would still be to high for our needs as we can
rely on the following observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each honest validator will only send one message (apart from duplicates on
timeout) per candidate/dispute.</li>
<li>An honest validator needs to fully recover availability and validate the
candidate for casting a vote.</li>
</ol>
<p>With these two observations, we can conclude that honest validators will usually
not send messages at a high rate. We can therefore enforce conservative rate
limits and thus minimize harm spamming malicious nodes can have.</p>
<p>Before we dive into how rate limiting solves all spam issues elegantly, let's
discuss that honest behaviour further:</p>
<p>What about session changes? Here we might have to inform a new validator set of
lots of already existing disputes at once.</p>
<p>With observation 1) and a rate limit that is per peer, we are still good:</p>
<p>Let's assume a rate limit of one message per 200ms per sender. This means 5
messages from each validator per second. 5 messages means 5 disputes!
Conclusively, we will be able to conclude 5 disputes per second - no matter what
malicious actors are doing. This is assuming dispute messages are sent ordered,
but even if not perfectly ordered: On average it will be 5 disputes per second.</p>
<p>This is good enough! All those disputes are valid ones and will result in
slashing and disabling of validators. Let's assume all of them conclude <code>valid</code>,
and we disable validators only after 100 raised concluding valid disputes, we
would still start disabling misbehaving validators in only 20 seconds.</p>
<p>One could also think that in addition participation is expected to take longer,
which means on average we can import/conclude disputes faster than they are
generated - regardless of dispute spam. Unfortunately this is not necessarily
true: There might be parachains with very light load where recovery and
validation can be accomplished very quickly - maybe faster than we can import
those disputes.</p>
<p>This is probably an argument for not imposing a too low rate limit, although the
issue is more general: Even without any rate limit, if an attacker generates
disputes at a very high rate, nodes will be having trouble keeping participation
up, hence the problem should be mitigated at a <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/5898">more fundamental
layer</a>.</p>
<p>For nodes that have been offline for a while, the same argument as for session
changes holds, but matters even less: We assume 2/3 of nodes to be online, so
even if the worst case 1/3 offline happens and they could not import votes fast
enough (as argued above, they in fact can) it would not matter for consensus.</p>
<h3 id="rate-limiting"><a class="header" href="#rate-limiting">Rate Limiting</a></h3>
<p>As suggested previously, rate limiting allows to mitigate all threats that come
from malicious actors trying to overwhelm the system in order to get away without
a slash, when it comes to dispute-distribution. In this section we will explain
how in greater detail.</p>
<p>The idea is to open a queue with limited size for each peer. We will process
incoming messages as fast as we can by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check that the sending peer is actually a valid authority - otherwise drop
message and decrease reputation/disconnect.</li>
<li>Put message on the peer's queue, if queue is full - drop it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Every <code>RATE_LIMIT</code> seconds (or rather milliseconds), we pause processing
incoming requests to go a full circle and process one message from each queue.
Processing means <code>Batching</code> as explained in the next section.</p>
<h3 id="batching"><a class="header" href="#batching">Batching</a></h3>
<p>To achieve goal 2 we will batch incoming votes/messages together before passing
them on as a single batch to the <code>dispute-coordinator</code>. To adhere to goal 1 as
well, we will do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>For an incoming message, we check whether we have an existing batch for that
candidate, if not we import directly to the dispute-coordinator, as we have
to assume this is concerning a new dispute.</li>
<li>We open a batch and start collecting incoming messages for that candidate,
instead of immediately forwarding.</li>
<li>We keep collecting votes in the batch until we receive less than
<code>MIN_KEEP_BATCH_ALIVE_VOTES</code> unique votes in the last <code>BATCH_COLLECTING_INTERVAL</code>. This is
important to accommodate for goal 5 and also 3.</li>
<li>We send the whole batch to the dispute-coordinator.</li>
</ol>
<p>This together with rate limiting explained above ensures we will be able to
process valid disputes: We can limit the number of simultaneous existing batches
to some high value, but can be rather certain that this limit will never be
reached - hence we won't drop valid disputes:</p>
<p>Let's assume <code>MIN_KEEP_BATCH_ALIVE_VOTES</code> is 10, <code>BATCH_COLLECTING_INTERVAL</code>
is <code>500ms</code> and above <code>RATE_LIMIT</code> is <code>100ms</code>. 1/3 of validators are malicious,
so for 1000 this means around 330 malicious actors worst case.</p>
<p>All those actors can send a message every <code>100ms</code>, that is 10 per second. This
means at the begining of an attack they can open up around 3300 batches. Each
containing two votes. So memory usage is still negligible. In reality it is even
less, as we also demand 10 new votes to trickle in per batch in order to keep it
alive, every <code>500ms</code>. Hence for the first second, each batch requires 20 votes
each. Each message is 2 votes, so this means 10 messages per batch. Hence to
keep those batches alive 10 attackers are needed for each batch. This reduces
the number of opened batches by a factor of 10: So we only have 330 batches in 1
second - each containing 20 votes.</p>
<p>The next second: In order to further grow memory usage, attackers have to
maintain 10 messages per batch and second. Number of batches equals the number
of attackers, each has 10 messages per second, all are needed to maintain the
batches in memory. Therefore we have a hard cap of around 330 (number of
malicious nodes) open batches. Each can be filled with number of malicious
actor's votes. So 330 batches with each 330 votes: Let's assume approximately 100
bytes per signature/vote. This results in a worst case memory usage of
<code>330 * 330 * 100 ~= 10 MiB</code>.</p>
<p>For 10_000 validators, we are already in the Gigabyte range, which means that
with a validator set that large we might want to be more strict with the rate limit or
require a larger rate of incoming votes per batch to keep them alive.</p>
<p>For a thousand validators a limit on batches of around 1000 should never be
reached in practice. Hence due to rate limiting we have a very good chance to
not ever having to drop a potential valid dispute due to some resource limit.</p>
<p>Further safe guards are possible: The dispute-coordinator actually
confirms/denies imports. So once we receive a denial by the dispute-coordinator
for the initial imported votes, we can opt into flushing the batch immediately
and importing the votes. This swaps memory usage for more CPU usage, but if that
import is deemed invalid again we can immediately decrease the reputation of the
sending peers, so this should be a net win. For the time being we punt on this
for simplicity.</p>
<p>Instead of filling batches to maximize memory usage, attackers could also try to
overwhelm the dispute coordinator by only sending votes for new candidates all
the time. This attack vector is mitigated also by above rate limit and
decreasing the peer's reputation on denial of the invalid imports by the
coordinator.</p>
<h3 id="node-startup"><a class="header" href="#node-startup">Node Startup</a></h3>
<p>Nothing special happens on node startup. We expect the <code>dispute-coordinator</code> to
inform us about any ongoing disputes via <code>SendDispute</code> messages.</p>
<h2 id="backing-and-approval-votes"><a class="header" href="#backing-and-approval-votes">Backing and Approval Votes</a></h2>
<p>Backing and approval votes get imported when they arrive/are created via the
dispute coordinator by corresponding subsystems.</p>
<p>We assume that under normal operation each node will be aware of backing and
approval votes and optimize for that case. Nevertheless we want disputes to
conclude fast and reliable, therefore if a node is not aware of backing/approval
votes it can request the missing votes from the node that informed it about the
dispute (see <a href="node/disputes/dispute-distribution.html#Resiliency%5D">Resiliency</a></p>
<h2 id="resiliency"><a class="header" href="#resiliency">Resiliency</a></h2>
<p>The above protocol should be sufficient for most cases, but there are certain
cases we also want to have covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non validator nodes might be interested in ongoing voting, even before it is
recorded on chain.</li>
<li>Nodes might have missed votes, especially backing or approval votes.
Recovering them from chain is difficult and expensive, due to runtime upgrades
and untyped extrinsics.</li>
<li>More importantly, on era changes the new authority set, from the perspective
of approval-voting have no need to see &quot;old&quot; approval votes, hence they might
not see them, can therefore not import them into the dispute coordinator and
therefore no authority will put them on chain.</li>
</ul>
<p>To cover those cases, we introduce a second request/response protocol, which can
be handled on a lower priority basis as the one above. It consists of the
request/response messages as described in the [protocol
section][#vote-recovery].</p>
<p>Nodes may send those requests to validators, if they feel they are missing
votes. E.g. after some timeout, if no majority was reached yet in their point of
view or if they are not aware of any backing/approval votes for a received
disputed candidate.</p>
<p>The receiver of a <code>IHaveVotesRequest</code> message will do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>See if the sender is missing votes we are aware of - if so, respond with
those votes.</li>
<li>Check whether the sender knows about any votes, we don't know about and if so
send a <code>IHaveVotesRequest</code> request back, with our knowledge.</li>
<li>Record the peer's knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<p>When to send <code>IHaveVotesRequest</code> messages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whenever we are asked to do so via
<code>DisputeDistributionMessage::FetchMissingVotes</code>.</li>
<li>Approximately once per block to some random validator as long as the dispute
is active.</li>
</ol>
<p>Spam considerations: Nodes want to accept those messages once per validator and
per slot. They are free to drop more frequent requests or requests for stale
data. Requests coming from non validator nodes, can be handled on a best effort
basis.</p>
<h2 id="considerations"><a class="header" href="#considerations">Considerations</a></h2>
<p>Dispute distribution is critical. We should keep track of available validator
connections and issue warnings if we are not connected to a majority of
validators. We should also keep track of failed sending attempts and log
warnings accordingly. As disputes are rare and TCP is a reliable protocol,
probably each failed attempt should trigger a warning in logs and also logged
into some Prometheus metric.</p>
<h2 id="disputes-for-non-available-candidates"><a class="header" href="#disputes-for-non-available-candidates">Disputes for non available candidates</a></h2>
<p>If deemed necessary we can later on also support disputes for non available
candidates, but disputes for those cases have totally different requirements.</p>
<p>First of all such disputes are not time critical. We just want to have
some offender slashed at some point, but we have no risk of finalizing any bad
data.</p>
<p>Second, as we won't have availability for such data, the node that initiated the
dispute will be responsible for providing the disputed data initially. Then
nodes which did the check already are also providers of the data, hence
distributing load and making prevention of the dispute from concluding harder
and harder over time. Assuming an attacker can not DoS a node forever, the
dispute will succeed eventually, which is all that matters. And again, even if
an attacker managed to prevent such a dispute from happening somehow, there is
no real harm done: There was no serious attack to begin with.</p>

<p>The utility subsystems are an assortment which don't have a natural home in another subsystem collection.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="availability-store"><a class="header" href="#availability-store">Availability Store</a></h1>
<p>This is a utility subsystem responsible for keeping available certain data and pruning that data.</p>
<p>The two data types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full PoV blocks of candidates we have validated</li>
<li>Availability chunks of candidates that were backed and noted available on-chain.</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of these data we have pruning rules that determine how long we need to keep that data available.</p>
<p>PoV hypothetically only need to be kept around until the block where the data was made fully available is finalized.
However, disputes can revert finality, so we need to be a bit more conservative and we add a delay. We should keep the
PoV until a block that finalized availability of it has been finalized for 1 day + 1 hour.</p>
<p>Availability chunks need to be kept available until the dispute period for the corresponding candidate has ended. We can
accomplish this by using the same criterion as the above. This gives us a pruning condition of the block finalizing
availability of the chunk being final for 1 day + 1 hour.</p>
<p>There is also the case where a validator commits to make a PoV available, but the corresponding candidate is never
backed. In this case, we keep the PoV available for 1 hour.</p>
<p>There may be multiple competing blocks all ending the availability phase for a particular candidate. Until finality, it
will be unclear which of those is actually the canonical chain, so the pruning records for PoVs and Availability chunks
should keep track of all such blocks.</p>

<h2 id="database-schema-2"><a class="header" href="#database-schema-2">Database Schema</a></h2>
<p>We use an underlying Key-Value database where we assume we have the following operations available:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>write(key, value)</code></li>
<li><code>read(key) -&gt; Option&lt;value&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>iter_with_prefix(prefix) -&gt; Iterator&lt;(key, value)&gt;</code> - gives all keys and values in lexicographical order where the
key starts with <code>prefix</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use this database to encode the following schema:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {

<p>Timestamps are the wall-clock seconds since Unix epoch. Timestamps and block numbers are both encoded as big-endian so
lexicographic order is ascending.</p>
<p>The meta information that we track per-candidate is defined as the <code>CandidateMeta</code> struct</p>

<p>This subsystem is responsible for handling candidate validation requests. It is a simple request/response server.</p>
<p>A variety of subsystems want to know if a parachain block candidate is valid. None of them care about the detailed
mechanics of how a candidate gets validated, just the results. This subsystem handles those details.</p>
<h2 id="protocol-16"><a class="header" href="#protocol-16">Protocol</a></h2>
<p>Input: <a href="node/utility/../../types/overseer-protocol.html#validation-request-type"><code>CandidateValidationMessage</code></a></p>
<p>Output: Validation result via the provided response side-channel.</p>
<h2 id="functionality-12"><a class="header" href="#functionality-12">Functionality</a></h2>
<p>This subsystem groups the requests it handles in two categories:  <em>candidate validation</em> and <em>PVF pre-checking</em>.</p>
<p>The first category can be further subdivided in two request types: one which draws out validation data from the state,
and another which accepts all validation data exhaustively. Validation returns three possible outcomes on the response
channel: the candidate is valid, the candidate is invalid, or an internal error occurred.</p>
<p>Parachain candidates are validated against their validation function: A piece of Wasm code that describes the
state-transition of the parachain. Validation function execution is not metered. This means that an execution which is
an infinite loop or simply takes too long must be forcibly exited by some other means. For this reason, we recommend
dispatching candidate validation to be done on subprocesses which can be killed if they time-out.</p>
<p>Upon receiving a validation request, the first thing the candidate validation subsystem should do is make sure it has
all the necessary parameters to the validation function. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Validation Function itself.</li>
<li>The <a href="node/utility/../../types/candidate.html#candidatedescriptor"><code>CandidateDescriptor</code></a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="node/utility/../../types/candidate.html#validationdata"><code>ValidationData</code></a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="node/utility/../../types/availability.html#proofofvalidity"><code>PoV</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second category is for PVF pre-checking. This is primarly used by the <a href="node/utility/pvf-prechecker.html">PVF pre-checker</a>
subsystem.</p>
<h3 id="determining-parameters"><a class="header" href="#determining-parameters">Determining Parameters</a></h3>
<p>For a <a href="node/utility/../../types/overseer-protocol.html#validationrequesttype"><code>CandidateValidationMessage</code></a><code>::ValidateFromExhaustive</code>, these parameters are exhaustively provided.</p>
<p>For a <a href="node/utility/../../types/overseer-protocol.html#validationrequesttype"><code>CandidateValidationMessage</code></a><code>::ValidateFromChainState</code>, some more work needs to be done. Due to the
uncertainty of Availability Cores (implemented in the <a href="node/utility/../../runtime/scheduler.html"><code>Scheduler</code></a> module of the runtime),
a candidate at a particular relay-parent and for a particular para may have two different valid validation-data to be
executed under depending on what is assumed to happen if the para is occupying a core at the onset of the new block.
This is encoded as an <code>OccupiedCoreAssumption</code> in the runtime API.</p>
<p>The way that we can determine which assumption the candidate is meant to be executed under is simply to do an exhaustive
check of both possibilities based on the state of the relay-parent. First we fetch the validation data under the
assumption that the block occupying becomes available. If the <code>validation_data_hash</code> of the <code>CandidateDescriptor</code>
matches this validation data, we use that. Otherwise, if the <code>validation_data_hash</code> matches the validation data fetched
under the <code>TimedOut</code> assumption, we use that. Otherwise, we return a <code>ValidationResult::Invalid</code> response and conclude.</p>
<p>Then, we can fetch the validation code from the runtime based on which type of candidate this is. This gives us all the
parameters. The descriptor and PoV come from the request itself, and the other parameters have been derived from the
state.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: This would be a great place for caching to avoid making lots of runtime requests. That would need a job, though.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="execution-of-the-parachain-wasm"><a class="header" href="#execution-of-the-parachain-wasm">Execution of the Parachain Wasm</a></h3>
<p>Once we have all parameters, we can spin up a background task to perform the validation in a way that doesn't hold up
the entire event loop. Before invoking the validation function itself, this should first do some basic checks:</p>
<ul>
<li>The collator signature is valid</li>
<li>The PoV provided matches the <code>pov_hash</code> field of the descriptor</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details please see <a href="node/utility/pvf-host-and-workers.html">PVF Host and Workers</a>.</p>
<h3 id="checking-validation-outputs"><a class="header" href="#checking-validation-outputs">Checking Validation Outputs</a></h3>
<p>If we can assume the presence of the relay-chain state (that is, during processing
<a href="node/utility/../../types/overseer-protocol.html#validationrequesttype"><code>CandidateValidationMessage</code></a><code>::ValidateFromChainState</code>) we can run all the checks that the relay-chain would run
at the inclusion time thus confirming that the candidate will be accepted.</p>
<footer id="last-change">Last change: 2023-09-04, commit: <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/commit/a30092ab42">a30092ab42</a></footer><div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="pvf-host-and-workers"><a class="header" href="#pvf-host-and-workers">PVF Host and Workers</a></h1>
<p>The PVF host is responsible for handling requests to prepare and execute PVF
code blobs, which it sends to PVF workers running in their own child processes.</p>
<p>This system has two high-levels goals that we will touch on here: <em>determinism</em>
and <em>security</em>.</p>
<h2 id="determinism"><a class="header" href="#determinism">Determinism</a></h2>
<p>One high-level goal is to make PVF operations as deterministic as possible, to
reduce the rate of disputes. Disputes can happen due to e.g. a job timing out on
one machine, but not another. While we do not have full determinism, there are
some dispute reduction mechanisms in place right now.</p>
<h3 id="retrying-execution-requests"><a class="header" href="#retrying-execution-requests">Retrying execution requests</a></h3>
<p>If the execution request fails during <strong>preparation</strong>, we will retry if it is
possible that the preparation error was transient (e.g. if the error was a panic
or time out). We will only retry preparation if another request comes in after
15 minutes, to ensure any potential transient conditions had time to be
resolved. We will retry up to 5 times.</p>
<p>If the actual <strong>execution</strong> of the artifact fails, we will retry once if it was
a possibly transient error, to allow the conditions that led to the error to
hopefully resolve. We use a more brief delay here (1 second as opposed to 15
minutes for preparation (see above)), because a successful execution must happen
in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>We currently know of the following specific cases that will lead to a retried
execution request:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>OOM:</strong> The host might have been temporarily low on memory due to other
processes running on the same machine. <strong>NOTE:</strong> This case will lead to
voting against the candidate (and possibly a dispute) if the retry is still
not successful.</li>
<li><strong>Artifact missing:</strong> The prepared artifact might have been deleted due to
operator error or some bug in the system.</li>
<li><strong>Panic:</strong> The worker thread panicked for some indeterminate reason, which
may or may not be independent of the candidate or PVF.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="preparation-timeouts"><a class="header" href="#preparation-timeouts">Preparation timeouts</a></h3>
<p>We use timeouts for both preparation and execution jobs to limit the amount of
time they can take. As the time for a job can vary depending on the machine and
load on the machine, this can potentially lead to disputes where some validators
successfuly execute a PVF and others don't.</p>
<p>One dispute mitigation we have in place is a more lenient timeout for
preparation during execution than during pre-checking. The rationale is that the
PVF has already passed pre-checking, so we know it should be valid, and we allow
it to take longer than expected, as this is likely due to an issue with the
machine and not the PVF.</p>
<h3 id="cpu-clock-timeouts"><a class="header" href="#cpu-clock-timeouts">CPU clock timeouts</a></h3>
<p>Another timeout-related mitigation we employ is to measure the time taken by
jobs using CPU time, rather than wall clock time. This is because the CPU time
of a process is less variable under different system conditions. When the
overall system is under heavy load, the wall clock time of a job is affected
more than the CPU time.</p>
<h3 id="internal-errors"><a class="header" href="#internal-errors">Internal errors</a></h3>
<p>In general, for errors not raising a dispute we have to be very careful. This is
only sound, if we either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ruled out that error in pre-checking. If something is not checked in
pre-checking, even if independent of the candidate and PVF, we must raise a
dispute.</li>
<li>We are 100% confident that it is a hardware/local issue: Like corrupted file,
etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Reasoning: Otherwise it would be possible to register a PVF where candidates can
not be checked, but we don't get a dispute - so nobody gets punished. Second, we
end up with a finality stall that is not going to resolve!</p>
<p>There are some error conditions where we can't be sure whether the candidate is
really invalid or some internal glitch occurred, e.g. panics. Whenever we are
unsure, we can never treat an error as internal as we would abstain from voting.
So we will first retry the candidate, and if the issue persists we are forced to
vote invalid.</p>
<h2 id="security"><a class="header" href="#security">Security</a></h2>
<p>With <a href="https://github.com/orgs/paritytech/projects/67">on-demand parachains</a>, it
is much easier to submit PVFs to the chain for preparation and execution. This
makes it easier for erroneous disputes and slashing to occur, whether
intentional (as a result of a malicious attacker) or not (a bug or operator
error occurred).</p>
<p>Therefore, another goal of ours is to harden our security around PVFs, in order
to protect the economic interests of validators and increase overall confidence
in the system.</p>
<h3 id="possible-attacks--threat-model"><a class="header" href="#possible-attacks--threat-model">Possible attacks / threat model</a></h3>
<p>Webassembly is already sandboxed, but there have already been reported multiple
CVEs enabling remote code execution. See e.g. these two advisories from
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-ff4p-7xrq-q5r8">Mar 2023</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-7f6x-jwh5-m9r4">Jul 2022</a>.</p>
<p>So what are we actually worried about? Things that come to mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Consensus faults</strong> - If an attacker can get some source of randomness they
could vote against with 50% chance and cause unresolvable disputes.</li>
<li><strong>Targeted slashes</strong> - An attacker can target certain validators (e.g. some
validators running on vulnerable hardware) and make them vote invalid and get
them slashed.</li>
<li><strong>Mass slashes</strong> - With some source of randomness they can do an untargeted
attack. I.e. a baddie can do significant economic damage by voting against
with 1/3 chance, without even stealing keys or completely replacing the
binary.</li>
<li><strong>Stealing keys</strong> - That would be pretty bad. Should not be possible with
sandboxing. We should at least not allow filesystem-access or network access.</li>
<li><strong>Taking control over the validator.</strong> E.g. replacing the <code>polkadot</code> binary
with a <code>polkadot-evil</code> binary. Should again not be possible with the above
sandboxing in place.</li>
<li><strong>Intercepting and manipulating packages</strong> - Effect very similar to the
above, hard to do without also being able to do 4 or 5.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="restricting-file-system-access"><a class="header" href="#restricting-file-system-access">Restricting file-system access</a></h3>
<p>A basic security mechanism is to make sure that any process directly interfacing
with untrusted code does not have unnecessary access to the file-system. This
provides some protection against attackers accessing sensitive data or modifying
data on the host machine.</p>
<p><em>Currently this is only supported on Linux.</em></p>
<!-- TODO: Uncomment when this has been enabled. -->
<!-- ### Restricting networking -->
<!-- We also disable networking on PVF threads by disabling certain syscalls, such as -->
<!-- the creation of sockets. This prevents attackers from either downloading -->
<!-- payloads or communicating sensitive data from the validator's machine to the -->
<!-- outside world. -->
<!-- *Currently this is only supported on Linux.* -->
<h3 id="clearing-env-vars"><a class="header" href="#clearing-env-vars">Clearing env vars</a></h3>
<p>We clear environment variables before handling untrusted code, because why give
attackers potentially sensitive data unnecessarily? And even if everything else
is locked down, env vars can potentially provide a source of randomness (see
point 1, &quot;Consensus faults&quot; above).</p>

<p>Relay chain block authorship authority is governed by BABE and is beyond the scope of the Overseer and the rest of the
subsystems. That said, ultimately the block author needs to select a set of backable parachain candidates and other
consensus data, and assemble a block from them. This subsystem is responsible for providing the necessary data to all
potential block authors.</p>
<h2 id="provisionable-data"><a class="header" href="#provisionable-data">Provisionable Data</a></h2>
<p>There are several distinct types of provisionable data, but they share this property in common: all should eventually be
included in a relay chain block.</p>
<h3 id="backed-candidates"><a class="header" href="#backed-candidates">Backed Candidates</a></h3>
<p>The block author can choose 0 or 1 backed parachain candidates per parachain; the only constraint is that each backable
candidate has the appropriate relay parent. However, the choice of a backed candidate must be the block author's. The
provisioner subsystem is how those block authors make this choice in practice.</p>
<h3 id="signed-bitfields"><a class="header" href="#signed-bitfields">Signed Bitfields</a></h3>
<p><a href="node/utility/../../types/availability.html#signed-availability-bitfield">Signed bitfields</a> are attestations from a particular
validator about which candidates it believes are available. Those will only be provided on fresh leaves.</p>
<h3 id="misbehavior-reports"><a class="header" href="#misbehavior-reports">Misbehavior Reports</a></h3>
<p>Misbehavior reports are self-contained proofs of misbehavior by a validator or group of validators. For example, it is
very easy to verify a double-voting misbehavior report: the report contains two votes signed by the same key, advocating
different outcomes. Concretely, misbehavior reports become inherents which cause dots to be slashed.</p>
<p>Note that there is no mechanism in place which forces a block author to include a misbehavior report which it doesn't
like, for example if it would be slashed by such a report. The chain's defense against this is to have a relatively long
slash period, such that it's likely to encounter an honest author before the slash period expires.</p>
<h3 id="dispute-inherent"><a class="header" href="#dispute-inherent">Dispute Inherent</a></h3>
<p>The dispute inherent is similar to a misbehavior report in that it is an attestation of misbehavior on the part of a
validator or group of validators. Unlike a misbehavior report, it is not self-contained: resolution requires coordinated
action by several validators. The canonical example of a dispute inherent involves an approval checker discovering that
a set of validators has improperly approved an invalid parachain block: resolving this requires the entire validator set
to re-validate the block, so that the minority can be slashed.</p>
<p>Dispute resolution is complex and is explained in substantially more detail <a href="node/utility/../../runtime/disputes.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="protocol-17"><a class="header" href="#protocol-17">Protocol</a></h2>
<p>The subsystem should maintain a set of handles to Block Authorship Provisioning iterations that are currently live.</p>

<p>Input: <a href="node/utility/../../types/overseer-protocol.html#provisioner-message"><code>ProvisionerMessage</code></a>. Backed candidates come from the

<li><code>Misbehavior::MultipleCandidates</code></li>
<li><code>Misbehavior::UnauthorizedStatement</code></li>
<li><code>Misbehavior::DoubleSign</code></li>
</ol>
<p>But we choose not to punish these forms of misbehavior for the time being. Risks from misbehavior are sufficiently
mitigated at the protocol level via reputation changes. Punitive actions here may become desirable enough to dedicate
time to in the future.</p>
<p>At initialization, this subsystem has no outputs.</p>
<p>Block authors request the inherent data they should use for constructing the inherent in the block which contains
parachain execution information.</p>
<h2 id="block-production"><a class="header" href="#block-production">Block Production</a></h2>
<p>When a validator is selected by BABE to author a block, it becomes a block producer. The provisioner is the subsystem
best suited to choosing which specific backed candidates and availability bitfields should be assembled into the block.
To engage this functionality, a <code>ProvisionerMessage::RequestInherentData</code> is sent; the response is a
<a href="node/utility/../../types/runtime.html#parainherentdata"><code>ParaInherentData</code></a>. Each relay chain block backs at most one backable
parachain block candidate per parachain. Additionally no further block candidate can be backed until the previous one
either gets declared available or expired. If bitfields indicate that candidate A, predecessor of B, should be declared
available, then B can be backed in the same relay block. Appropriate bitfields, as outlined in the section on <a href="node/utility/provisioner.html#bitfield-selection">bitfield
selection</a>, and any dispute statements should be attached as well.</p>
<h3 id="bitfield-selection"><a class="header" href="#bitfield-selection">Bitfield Selection</a></h3>
<p>Our goal with respect to bitfields is simple: maximize availability. However, it's not quite as simple as always
including all bitfields; there are constraints which still need to be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>not more than one bitfield per validator</li>
<li>each 1 bit must correspond to an occupied core</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond that, a semi-arbitrary selection policy is fine. In order to meet the goal of maximizing availability, a
heuristic of picking the bitfield with the greatest number of 1 bits set in the event of conflict is useful.</p>
<h3 id="dispute-statement-selection"><a class="header" href="#dispute-statement-selection">Dispute Statement Selection</a></h3>
<p>This is the point at which the block author provides further votes to active disputes or initiates new disputes in the
runtime state.</p>
<p>The block-authoring logic of the runtime has an extra step between handling the inherent-data and producing the actual
inherent call, which we assume performs the work of filtering out disputes which are not relevant to the on-chain state.
Backing votes are always kept in the dispute statement set. This ensures we punish the maximum number of misbehaving
backers.</p>
<p>To select disputes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue a <code>DisputeCoordinatorMessage::RecentDisputes</code> message and wait for the response. This is a set of all disputes
in recent sessions which we are aware of.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="determining-bitfield-availability"><a class="header" href="#determining-bitfield-availability">Determining Bitfield Availability</a></h3>
<p>An occupied core has a <code>CoreAvailability</code> bitfield. We also have a list of <code>SignedAvailabilityBitfield</code>s. We need to
determine from these whether or not a core at a particular index has become available.</p>
<p>The key insight required is that <code>CoreAvailability</code> is transverse to the <code>SignedAvailabilityBitfield</code>s: if we
conceptualize the list of bitfields as many rows, each bit of which is its own column, then <code>CoreAvailability</code> for a
given core index is the vertical slice of bits in the set at that index.</p>
<p>To compute bitfield availability, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with a copy of <code>OccupiedCore.availability</code></li>
<li>For each bitfield in the list of <code>SignedAvailabilityBitfield</code>s:
<ul>
<li>Get the bitfield's <code>validator_index</code></li>
<li>Update the availability. Conceptually, assuming bit vectors: <code>availability[validator_index] |= bitfield[core_idx]</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Availability has a 2/3 threshold. Therefore: <code>3 * availability.count_ones() &gt;= 2 * availability.len()</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="candidate-selection-prospective-parachains-mode"><a class="header" href="#candidate-selection-prospective-parachains-mode">Candidate Selection: Prospective Parachains Mode</a></h3>
<p>The state of the provisioner <code>PerRelayParent</code> tracks an important setting, <code>ProspectiveParachainsMode</code>. This setting
determines which backable candidate selection method the provisioner uses.</p>
<p><code>ProspectiveParachainsMode::Disabled</code> - The provisioner uses its own internal legacy candidate selection.
<code>ProspectiveParachainsMode::Enabled</code> - The provisioner requests that <a href="node/utility/../backing/prospective-parachains.html">prospective
parachains</a> provide selected candidates.</p>
<p>Candidates selected with <code>ProspectiveParachainsMode::Enabled</code> are able to benefit from the increased block production
time asynchronous backing allows. For this reason all Polkadot protocol networks will eventually use prospective
parachains candidate selection. Then legacy candidate selection will be removed as obsolete.</p>
<h3 id="prospective-parachains-candidate-selection"><a class="header" href="#prospective-parachains-candidate-selection">Prospective Parachains Candidate Selection</a></h3>
<p>The goal of candidate selection is to determine which cores are free, and then to the degree possible, pick a candidate
appropriate to each free core. In prospective parachains candidate selection the provisioner handles the former process
while <a href="node/utility/../backing/prospective-parachains.html">prospective parachains</a> handles the latter.</p>
<p>To select backable candidates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the list of core states from the runtime API</li>
<li>For each core state:
<ul>
<li>On <code>CoreState::Free</code>
<ul>
<li>The core is unscheduled and doesn’t need to be provisioned with a candidate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On <code>CoreState::Scheduled</code>
<ul>
<li>The core is unoccupied and scheduled to accept a backed block for a particular <code>para_id</code>.</li>
<li>The provisioner requests a backable candidate from <a href="node/utility/../backing/prospective-parachains.html">prospective parachains</a>
with the desired relay parent, the core’s scheduled <code>para_id</code>, and an empty required path.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On <code>CoreState::Occupied</code>
<ul>
<li>The availability core is occupied by a parachain block candidate pending availability. A further candidate need
not be provided by the provisioner unless the core will be vacated this block. This is the case when either
bitfields indicate the current core occupant has been made available or a timeout is reached.</li>
<li>If <code>bitfields_indicate_availability</code>
<ul>
<li>If <code>Some(scheduled_core) = occupied_core.next_up_on_available</code>, the core will be vacated and in need of a
provisioned candidate. The provisioner requests a backable candidate from <a href="node/utility/../backing/prospective-parachains.html">prospective
parachains</a> with the core’s scheduled <code>para_id</code> and a required path with
one entry. This entry corresponds to the parablock candidate previously occupying this core, which was made
available and can be built upon even though it hasn’t been seen as included in a relay chain block yet. See the
Required Path section below for more detail.</li>
<li>If <code>occupied_core.next_up_on_available</code> is <code>None</code>, then the core being vacated is unscheduled and doesn’t need
to be provisioned with a candidate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Else-if <code>occupied_core.time_out_at == block_number</code>
<ul>
<li>If <code>Some(scheduled_core) = occupied_core.next_up_on_timeout</code>, the core will be vacated and in need of a
provisioned candidate. A candidate is requested in exactly the same way as with <code>CoreState::Scheduled</code>.</li>
<li>Else the core being vacated is unscheduled and doesn’t need to be provisioned with a candidate The end result of
this process is a vector of <code>CandidateHash</code>s, sorted in order of their core index.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="required-path"><a class="header" href="#required-path">Required Path</a></h4>
<p>Required path is a parameter for <code>ProspectiveParachainsMessage::GetBackableCandidate</code>, which the provisioner sends in
candidate selection.</p>
<p>An empty required path indicates that the requested candidate should be a direct child of the most recently included
parablock for the given <code>para_id</code> as of the given relay parent.</p>
<p>In contrast, a required path with one or more entries prompts <a href="node/utility/../backing/prospective-parachains.html">prospective
parachains</a> to step forward through its fragment tree for the given <code>para_id</code> and
relay parent until the desired parablock is reached. We then select a direct child of that parablock to pass to the
provisioner.</p>
<p>The parablocks making up a required path do not need to have been previously seen as included in relay chain blocks.
Thus the ability to provision backable candidates based on a required path effectively decouples backing from inclusion.</p>
<h3 id="legacy-candidate-selection"><a class="header" href="#legacy-candidate-selection">Legacy Candidate Selection</a></h3>
<p>Legacy candidate selection takes place in the provisioner. Thus the provisioner needs to keep an up to date record of
all <a href="node/utility/../../types/backing.html#backed-candidate">backed_candidates</a> <code>PerRelayParent</code> to pick from.</p>
<p>The goal of candidate selection is to determine which cores are free, and then to the degree possible, pick a candidate
appropriate to each free core.</p>
<p>To determine availability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the list of core states from the runtime API</li>
<li>For each core state:
<ul>
<li>On <code>CoreState::Scheduled</code>, then we can make an <code>OccupiedCoreAssumption::Free</code>.</li>
<li>On <code>CoreState::Occupied</code>, then we may be able to make an assumption:
<ul>
<li>If the bitfields indicate availability and there is a scheduled <code>next_up_on_available</code>, then we can make an
<code>OccupiedCoreAssumption::Included</code>.</li>
<li>If the bitfields do not indicate availability, and there is a scheduled <code>next_up_on_time_out</code>, and
<code>occupied_core.time_out_at == block_number_under_production</code>, then we can make an
<code>OccupiedCoreAssumption::TimedOut</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If we did not make an <code>OccupiedCoreAssumption</code>, then continue on to the next core.</li>
<li>Now compute the core's <code>validation_data_hash</code>: get the <code>PersistedValidationData</code> from the runtime, given the known
<code>ParaId</code> and <code>OccupiedCoreAssumption</code>;</li>
<li>Find an appropriate candidate for the core.
<ul>
<li>There are two constraints: <code>backed_candidate.candidate.descriptor.para_id == scheduled_core.para_id &amp;&amp; candidate.candidate.descriptor.validation_data_hash == computed_validation_data_hash</code>.</li>
<li>In the event that more than one candidate meets the constraints, selection between the candidates is arbitrary.
However, not more than one candidate can be selected per core.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The end result of this process is a vector of <code>CandidateHash</code>s, sorted in order of their core index.</p>
<h3 id="retrieving-full-backedcandidates-for-selected-hashes"><a class="header" href="#retrieving-full-backedcandidates-for-selected-hashes">Retrieving Full <code>BackedCandidate</code>s for Selected Hashes</a></h3>
<p>Legacy candidate selection and prospective parachains candidate selection both leave us with a vector of

<p>The response is a vector of <code>BackedCandidate</code>s, sorted in order of their core index and ready to be provisioned to block
authoring. The candidate selection and retrieval process should select at maximum one candidate which upgrades the

<p>One of the main features of the overseer/subsystem duality is to avoid shared ownership of resources and to communicate
via message-passing. However, implementing each networking subsystem as its own network protocol brings a fair share of
challenges.</p>
<p>The most notable challenge is coordinating and eliminating race conditions of peer connection and disconnection events.
If we have many network protocols that peers are supposed to be connected on, it is difficult to enforce that a peer is
indeed connected on all of them or the order in which those protocols receive notifications that peers have connected.
This becomes especially difficult when attempting to share peer state across protocols. All of the Parachain-Host's
gossip protocols eliminate DoS with a data-dependency on current chain heads. However, it is inefficient and confusing
to implement the logic for tracking our current chain heads as well as our peers' on each of those subsystems. Having
one subsystem for tracking this shared state and distributing it to the others is an improvement in architecture and
efficiency.</p>
<p>One other piece of shared state to track is peer reputation. When peers are found to have provided value or cost, we
adjust their reputation accordingly.</p>
<p>So in short, this Subsystem acts as a bridge between an actual network component and a subsystem's protocol. The
implementation of the underlying network component is beyond the scope of this module. We make certain assumptions about
the network component:</p>
<ul>
<li>The network allows registering of protocols and multiple versions of each protocol.</li>
<li>The network handles version negotiation of protocols with peers and only connects the peer on the highest version of
the protocol.</li>
<li>Each protocol has its own peer-set, although there may be some overlap.</li>
<li>The network provides peer-set management utilities for discovering the peer-IDs of validators and a means of dialing
peers with given IDs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The network bridge makes use of the peer-set feature, but is not generic over peer-set. Instead, it exposes two
peer-sets that event producers can attach to: <code>Validation</code> and <code>Collation</code>. More information can be found on the
documentation of the <a href="node/utility/../../types/overseer-protocol.html#network-bridge-message"><code>NetworkBridgeMessage</code></a>.</p>

<p>The Gossip Support Subsystem is responsible for keeping track of session changes
and issuing a connection request to all validators in the next, current and
a few past sessions if we are a validator in these sessions.
The request will add all validators to a reserved PeerSet, meaning we will not
reject a connection request from any validator in that set.</p>
<p>In addition to that, it creates a gossip overlay topology per session which
limits the amount of messages sent and received to be an order of sqrt of the
validators. Our neighbors in this graph will be forwarded to the network bridge
with the <code>NetworkBridgeMessage::NewGossipTopology</code> message.</p>
<p>See https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/3239 for more details.</p>
<p>The gossip topology is used by parachain distribution subsystems,
such as Bitfield Distribution, (small) Statement Distribution and
Approval Distribution to limit the amount of peers we send messages to
and handle view updates.</p>

<p>Simple implementations of these updates do <code>O(n_unfinalized_blocks)</code> disk operations. If the amount of unfinalized
blocks is relatively small, the updates should not take very much time. However, in cases where there are hundreds or
thousands of unfinalized blocks the naive implementations of these update algorithms would have to be replaced with more
sophisticated versions.</p>

<p>The PVF pre-checker is a subsystem that is responsible for watching the relay chain for new PVFs that require
pre-checking. Head over to <a href="node/utility/../../pvf-prechecking.html">overview</a> for the PVF pre-checking process overview.</p>
<h2 id="protocol-22"><a class="header" href="#protocol-22">Protocol</a></h2>
<p>There is no dedicated input mechanism for PVF pre-checker. Instead, PVF pre-checker looks on the <code>ActiveLeavesUpdate</code>
event stream for work.</p>
<p>This subsytem does not produce any output messages either. The subsystem will, however, send messages to the [Runtime
API] subsystem to query for the pending PVFs and to submit votes. In addition to that, it will also communicate with
<a href="node/utility/candidate-validation.html">Candidate Validation</a> Subsystem to request PVF pre-check.</p>
<h2 id="functionality-17"><a class="header" href="#functionality-17">Functionality</a></h2>
<p>If the node is running in a collator mode, this subsystem will be disabled. The PVF pre-checker subsystem keeps track of
the PVFs that are relevant for the subsystem.</p>
<p>To be relevant for the subsystem, a PVF must be returned by the <a href="node/utility/../../runtime-api/pvf-prechecking.html"><code>pvfs_require_precheck</code> runtime API</a> in any of the active leaves. If the PVF is not present in any of the active leaves, it ceases to be
relevant.</p>
<p>When a PVF just becomes relevant, the subsystem will send a message to the <a href="node/utility/candidate-validation.html">Candidate Validation</a> subsystem asking for
the pre-check.</p>
<p>Upon receving a message from the candidate-validation subsystem, the pre-checker will note down that the PVF has its
judgement and will also sign and submit a <a href="node/utility/../../types/pvf-prechecking.html#pvfcheckstatement"><code>PvfCheckStatement</code></a> via the <a href="node/utility/../../runtime-api/pvf-prechecking.html"><code>submit_pvf_check_statement</code>
runtime API</a>. In case, a judgement was received for a PVF that is no longer in view it is
ignored.</p>
<p>Since a vote only is valid during <a href="node/utility/../../pvf-prechecking.html">one session</a>, the subsystem will have to resign and submit the statements
for the new session. The new session is assumed to be started if at least one of the leaves has a greater session index
that was previously observed in any of the leaves.</p>
<p>The subsystem tracks all the statements that it submitted within a session. If for some reason a PVF became irrelevant
and then becomes relevant again, the subsystem will not submit a new statement for that PVF within the same session.</p>
<p>If the node is not in the active validator set, it will still perform all the checks. However, it will only submit the
check statements when the node is in the active validator set.</p>
<h3 id="rejecting-failed-pvfs"><a class="header" href="#rejecting-failed-pvfs">Rejecting failed PVFs</a></h3>
<p>It is possible that the candidate validation was not able to check the PVF, e.g. if it timed out. In that case, the PVF
pre-checker will vote against it. This is considered safe, as there is no slashing for being on the wrong side of a
pre-check vote.</p>
<p>Rejecting instead of abstaining is better in several ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Conclusion is reached faster - we have actual votes, instead of relying on a timeout.</li>
<li>Being strict in pre-checking makes it safer to be more lenient in preparation errors afterwards. Hence we have more
leeway in avoiding raising dubious disputes, without making things less secure.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, if we only abstain, an attacker can specially craft a PVF wasm blob so that it will fail on e.g. 50% of the
validators. In that case a supermajority will never be reached and the vote will repeat multiple times, most likely with
the same result (since all votes are cleared on a session change). This is avoided by rejecting failed PVFs, and by only
requiring 1/3 of validators to reject a PVF to reach a decision.</p>
<h3 id="note-on-disputes"><a class="header" href="#note-on-disputes">Note on Disputes</a></h3>
<p>Having a pre-checking phase allows us to make certain assumptions later when preparing the PVF for execution. If a
runtime passed pre-checking, then we know that the runtime should be valid, and therefore any issue during preparation
for execution can be assumed to be a local problem on the current node.</p>
<p>For this reason, even deterministic preparation errors should not trigger disputes. And since we do not dispute as a
result of the pre-checking phase, as stated above, it should be impossible for preparation in general to result in
disputes.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="candidate-types"><a class="header" href="#candidate-types">Candidate Types</a></h1>
<p>Para candidates are some of the most common types, both within the runtime and on the Node-side. Candidates are the
fundamental datatype for advancing parachains, encapsulating the collator's signature, the context of the parablock, the
commitments to the output, and a commitment to the data which proves it valid.</p>
<p>In a way, this entire guide is about these candidates: how they are scheduled, constructed, backed, included, and
challenged.</p>
<p>This section will describe the base candidate type, its components, and variants that contain extra data.</p>
<h2 id="para-id"><a class="header" href="#para-id">Para Id</a></h2>
<p>A unique 32-bit identifier referring to a specific para (chain or thread). The relay-chain runtime guarantees that
<code>ParaId</code>s are unique for the duration of any session, but recycling and reuse over a longer period of time is permitted.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct ParaId(u32);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="candidate-receipt"><a class="header" href="#candidate-receipt">Candidate Receipt</a></h2>
<p>Much info in a <a href="types/candidate.html#full-candidate-receipt"><code>FullCandidateReceipt</code></a> is duplicated from the relay-chain state. When the
corresponding relay-chain state is considered widely available, the Candidate Receipt should be favored over the
<code>FullCandidateReceipt</code>.</p>
<p>Examples of situations where the state is readily available includes within the scope of work done by subsystems working
on a given relay-parent, or within the logic of the runtime importing a backed candidate.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>/// A candidate-receipt.
struct CandidateReceipt {
	/// The descriptor of the candidate.
	descriptor: CandidateDescriptor,
	/// The hash of the encoded commitments made as a result of candidate execution.
	commitments_hash: Hash,
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="full-candidate-receipt"><a class="header" href="#full-candidate-receipt">Full Candidate Receipt</a></h2>
<p>This is the full receipt type. The <code>PersistedValidationData</code> are technically redundant with the <code>inner.relay_parent</code>,
which uniquely describes the block in the blockchain from whose state these values are derived. The
<a href="types/candidate.html#candidate-receipt"><code>CandidateReceipt</code></a> variant is often used instead for this reason.</p>
<p>However, the Full Candidate Receipt type is useful as a means of avoiding the implicit dependency on availability of old
blockchain state. In situations such as availability and approval, having the full description of the candidate within a
self-contained struct is convenient.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]

}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="committed-candidate-receipt"><a class="header" href="#committed-candidate-receipt">Committed Candidate Receipt</a></h2>
<p>This is a variant of the candidate receipt which includes the commitments of the candidate receipt alongside the
descriptor. This should be favored over the <a href="types/candidate.html#candidate-receipt"><code>Candidate Receipt</code></a> in situations where the candidate
is not going to be executed but the actual data committed to is important. This is often the case in the backing phase.</p>
<p>The hash of the committed candidate receipt will be the same as the corresponding <a href="types/candidate.html#candidate-receipt"><code>Candidate Receipt</code></a>, because it is computed by first hashing the encoding of the commitments to form a plain
<a href="types/candidate.html#candidate-receipt"><code>Candidate Receipt</code></a>.</p>

<h2 id="persistedvalidationdata"><a class="header" href="#persistedvalidationdata"><code>PersistedValidationData</code></a></h2>
<p>The validation data provides information about how to create the inputs for validation of a candidate. This information
is derived from the chain state and will vary from para to para, although some of the fields may be the same for every
para.</p>
<p>Since this data is used to form inputs to the validation function, it needs to be persisted by the availability system
to avoid dependence on availability of the relay-chain state.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the validation data acts as a way to authorize the additional data the collator needs to pass to the
validation function. For example, the validation function can check whether the incoming messages (e.g. downward
messages) were actually sent by using the data provided in the validation data using so called MQC heads.</p>
<p>Since the commitments of the validation function are checked by the relay-chain, approval checkers can rely on the
invariant that the relay-chain only includes para-blocks for which these checks have already been done. As such, there
is no need for the validation data used to inform validators and collators about the checks the relay-chain will perform
to be persisted by the availability system.</p>
<p>The <code>PersistedValidationData</code> should be relatively lightweight primarily because it is constructed during inclusion for
each candidate and therefore lies on the critical path of inclusion.</p>

<p>There are a few distinct types which we desire to sign, and validate the signatures of. Instead of duplicating this
work, we extract a signed wrapper.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">/// A signed type which encapsulates the common desire to sign some data and validate a signature.
///
/// Note that the internal fields are not public; they are all accessable by immutable getters.
/// This reduces the chance that they are accidentally mutated, invalidating the signature.

    /// The payload is part of the signed data. The rest is the signing context,
    /// which is known both at signing and at validation.

    fn validate(&amp;self, context: SigningContext, key: ValidatorId) -&gt; bool { ... }

</code></pre>
<p>Note the presence of the <a href="types/../types/candidate.html#signing-context"><code>SigningContext</code></a> in the signatures of the <code>sign</code> and
<code>validate</code> methods. To ensure cryptographic security, the actual signed payload is always the SCALE encoding of
<code>(payload.into(), signing_context)</code>. Including the signing context prevents replay attacks.</p>
<p><code>EncodeAs</code> is a helper trait with a blanket impl which ensures that any <code>T</code> can <code>EncodeAs&lt;T&gt;</code>. Therefore, for the
generic case where <code>RealPayload = Payload</code>, it changes nothing. However, we  <code>impl EncodeAs&lt;CompactStatement&gt; for Statement</code>, which helps efficiency.</p>

<p>Here you can find definitions of a bunch of jargon, usually specific to the Polkadot project.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approval Checker:</strong> A validator who randomly self-selects so to perform validity checks on a parablock which is
pending approval.</li>
<li><strong>BABE:</strong> (Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension). The algorithm validators use to safely extend the Relay Chain.
See <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-consensus">the Polkadot wiki</a> for more information.</li>
<li><strong>Backable Candidate:</strong> A Parachain Candidate which is backed by a majority of validators assigned to a given
parachain.</li>
<li><strong>Backed Candidate:</strong> A Backable Candidate noted in a relay-chain block</li>
<li><strong>Backing:</strong> A set of statements proving that a Parachain Candidate is backable.</li>
<li><strong>Collator:</strong> A node who generates Proofs-of-Validity (PoV) for blocks of a specific parachain.</li>
<li><strong>DMP:</strong> (Downward Message Passing). Message passing from the relay-chain to a parachain. Also there is a runtime
parachains module with the same name.</li>
<li><strong>DMQ:</strong> (Downward Message Queue). A message queue for messages from the relay-chain down to a parachain. A parachain
has exactly one downward message queue.</li>
<li><strong>Extrinsic:</strong> An element of a relay-chain block which triggers a specific entry-point of a runtime module with given
arguments.</li>
<li><strong>GRANDPA:</strong> (Ghost-based Recursive ANcestor Deriving Prefix Agreement). The algorithm validators use to guarantee
finality of the Relay Chain.</li>
<li><strong>HRMP:</strong> (Horizontally Relay-routed Message Passing). A mechanism for message passing between parachains (hence
horizontal) that leverages the relay-chain storage. Predates XCMP. Also there is a runtime parachains module with the
same name.</li>
<li><strong>Inclusion Pipeline:</strong> The set of steps taken to carry a Parachain Candidate from authoring, to backing, to
availability and full inclusion in an active fork of its parachain.</li>
<li><strong>Module:</strong> A component of the Runtime logic, encapsulating storage, routines, and entry-points.</li>
<li><strong>Module Entry Point:</strong> A recipient of new information presented to the Runtime. This may trigger routines.</li>
<li><strong>Module Routine:</strong> A piece of code executed within a module by block initialization, closing, or upon an entry point
being triggered. This may execute computation, and read or write storage.</li>
<li><strong>MQC:</strong> (Message Queue Chain). A cryptographic data structure that resembles an append-only linked list which doesn't
store original values but only their hashes. The whole structure is described by a single hash, referred as a &quot;head&quot;.
When a value is appended, it's contents hashed with the previous head creating a hash that becomes a new head.</li>
<li><strong>Node:</strong> A participant in the Polkadot network, who follows the protocols of communication and connection to other
nodes. Nodes form a peer-to-peer network topology without a central authority.</li>
<li><strong>Parachain Candidate, or Candidate:</strong> A proposed block for inclusion into a parachain.</li>
<li><strong>Parablock:</strong> A block in a parachain.</li>
<li><strong>Parachain:</strong> A constituent chain secured by the Relay Chain's validators.</li>
<li><strong>Parachain Validators:</strong> A subset of validators assigned during a period of time to back candidates for a specific
parachain</li>
<li><strong>On-demand parachain:</strong> A parachain which is scheduled on a pay-as-you-go basis.</li>
<li><strong>Lease holding parachain:</strong> A parachain possessing an active slot lease. The lease holder is assigned a single
availability core for the duration of the lease, granting consistent blockspace scheduling at the rate 1 parablock per
relay block.</li>
<li><strong>PDK (Parachain Development Kit):</strong> A toolset that allows one to develop a parachain. Cumulus is a PDK.</li>
<li><strong>Preimage:</strong> In our context, if <code>H(X) = Y</code> where <code>H</code> is a hash function and <code>Y</code> is the hash, then <code>X</code> is the hash
preimage.</li>
<li><strong>Proof-of-Validity (PoV):</strong> A stateless-client proof that a parachain candidate is valid, with respect to some
validation function.</li>
<li><strong>PVF:</strong> Parachain Validation Function. The validation code that is run by validators on parachains.</li>
<li><strong>PVF Prechecking:</strong> This is the process of initially checking the PVF when it is first added. We attempt preparation
of the PVF and make sure it succeeds within a given timeout, plus some additional checks.</li>
<li><strong>PVF Preparation:</strong> This is the process of preparing the WASM blob and includes both prevalidation and compilation.
As there is no prevalidation right now, preparation just consists of compilation.</li>
<li><strong>Relay Parent:</strong> A block in the relay chain, referred to in a context where work is being done in the context of the
state at this block.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime:</strong> The relay-chain state machine.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime Module:</strong> See Module.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime API:</strong> A means for the node-side behavior to access structured information based on the state of a fork of
the blockchain.</li>
<li><strong>Subsystem:</strong> A long-running task which is responsible for carrying out a particular category of work.</li>
<li><strong>UMP:</strong> (Upward Message Passing) A vertical message passing mechanism from a parachain to the relay chain.</li>
<li><strong>Validator:</strong> Specially-selected node in the network who is responsible for validating parachain blocks and issuing
attestations about their validity.</li>
<li><strong>Validation Function:</strong> A piece of Wasm code that describes the state-transition function of a parachain.</li>
<li><strong>VMP:</strong> (Vertical Message Passing) A family of mechanisms that are responsible for message exchange between the relay
chain and parachains.</li>
<li><strong>XCMP:</strong> (Cross-Chain Message Passing) A type of horizontal message passing (i.e. between parachains) that allows
secure message passing directly between parachains and has minimal resource requirements from the relay chain, thus
highly scalable.</li>
