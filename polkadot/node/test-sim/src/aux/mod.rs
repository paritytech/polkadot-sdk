//! Auxiliary subsystem helpers.

//! - Stubs / noops with no production-crate deps live here in the test-sim core (they're reusable
//!   across tenants).
//! - Real-subsystem spawners (prospective-parachains, candidate-backing) live in their per-tenant
//!   consumer crates. The generic [`spawn_aux`] helper builds the boilerplate so each consumer's
//!   spawn function is a one-liner.
