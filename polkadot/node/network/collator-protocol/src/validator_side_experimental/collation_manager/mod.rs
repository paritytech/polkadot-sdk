//! Segment-based collation management for the experimental validator side.
//!
//! Every advertisement is stored as a segment: V1 an empty-entries segment, V2/V3 a
//! single by-hash entry, V4 an age-ordered list of by-output-head fingerprints. A
//! stored segment is one fetch entitlement. The planner fills claim-queue positions
//! back-to-front, ranking the live segments for each position's para by collator
//! reputation, then earliest arrival. The picked segment is resolved to a fetch target
//! at fetch time: entries are walked oldest-first and the first entry that is not
//! blocked is launched. An entry is blocked when its output head is already fetched
//! (para-wide, across in-view scheduling parents), in flight, or known to prospective
//! parachains (whose snapshot unions candidate output heads with best-chain parent
//! heads, so an entry that would cycle the chain is blocked too). Blockers are
//! classified: prospective-parachains knowledge is hard (durable); fetched and
//! in-flight heads are soft (pending attempts that may still fail). A head that is
//! both is hard.
//!
//! A launch consumes the picked segment. A segment with no launchable entry is
//! consumed only when every entry is hard-blocked; with at least one soft blocker it
//! is held un-consumed instead — stored as the retry channel, picked again once the
//! pending attempt concludes. A failed fetch or an invalidated collation frees the
//! head and the held segment launches; a seconded one turns the blocker hard and the
//! segment is consumed on a later pick. Either way the position falls through to the
//! next-ranked segment. Consumption sets a flag; memory is reclaimed by a sweep at
//! the top of `note_fetched`, and consumed segments are invisible to every reader via
//! `live_segments`.
//!
//! The prospective-parachains record (`para_knowledge`) is replaced wholesale at leaf
//! activation and topped up with each candidate we second. Accepted staleness: up to
//! one block for other validators' candidates.
