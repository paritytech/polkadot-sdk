//! Test-sim-driven integration tests for `polkadot-collator-protocol`.
//!
//! Single integration target — Cargo's "1 file = 1 binary" rule applies to top-level
//! `tests/*.rs`; subdirectories below `tests/` are referenced via `mod` from this file
//! and compile into the same binary. Saves on link time + keeps `cargo test` output
//! readable.
//!
//! # Topics
//!
//! - `advertisement.rs`        Declare → advertise → accept/reject, spam protection, v1
//!   advertisement-on-non-leaf, AssetHub permissionless.
//! - `fetching.rs`             Fetch queueing, retries, timeouts, fairness, per-RP serialisation.
//! - `seconding.rs`            Full advertise→fetch→respond→second pipelines, fragment-chain
//!   seconding, multi-candidate seconding.
//! - `declare_and_peer.rs`     Declare validation, malicious-para handling, peer-disconnect /
//!   view-change effects.
//! - `scheduling_and_cq.rs`    Per-leaf claim-queue shape, claims counting, group rotation, V3
//!   scheduling-parent semantics.
//! - `descriptors.rs`          V1 / V3 descriptor handling: version detection, session-index
//!   checks.
//! - `divergent.rs`            Legacy vs experimental divergences (intended or bug_on-tracked).
