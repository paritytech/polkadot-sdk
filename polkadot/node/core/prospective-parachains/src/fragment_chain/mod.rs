//! Utility for managing parachain fragments not referenced by the relay-chain.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The main type exposed by this module is the [`FragmentChain`].
//!
//! Each fragment chain is associated with a particular relay chain block (called scheduling
//! parent). Fragment chains are created for each active leaf and retained as long as the block
//! remains in the ancestry of any active leaf. Its configuration is split into two parts:
//! - A [`SchedulingScope`] shared across all parachains, containing the scheduling parent block and
//!   its ancestors (up to `scheduling_lookahead - 1`, bounded by session boundaries) —
//!   `scheduling_lookahead` blocks in total. Prior to V3 descriptors, both the relay parent and the
//!   scheduling parent need to be within this scope. With v3 descriptors, they may differ, and the
//!   relay parent may be much older (up to `HostConfiguration.max_relay_parent_session_age`)
//!   sessions old.
//!
//! - A [`Scope`] per parachain, containing the base constraints derived from the latest included
//!   candidate, the candidates pending availability, and the maximum chain length.
//!
//! Each parachain has a single `FragmentChain` for each scheduling parent block in the view where
//! it is scheduled.
//!
//! A fragment chain consists of two parts: the **chain** and the **unconnected storage**.
//!
//! The **chain** is a linear sequence of backed candidates building on top of each other, starting
//! from the candidates pending availability (which form the prefix). The chain has a maximum
//! length of `pending_availability_count + claim_queue_depth`, where `claim_queue_depth` is the
//! number of claim queue slots this parachain occupies across all assigned cores. Only backed
//! candidates may be added to the chain, and in the presence of forks, the fork selection rule
//! determines which candidate is chosen.
//!
//! The **unconnected storage** holds seconded and backable candidates that may be added to the
//! chain in the future. When a candidate is first seconded, it enters this storage. Only after it
//! reaches the backing quorum may it be promoted to the chain — and only if it builds on the
//! chain tip and is preferred by the fork selection rule.
//!
//! Candidates in the unconnected storage may have any relationship between them: they may form
//! trees, be completely unrelated, or even form cycles. This is intentional — it allows
//! parallelizing the backing process across different groups (for elastic scaling) and accepting
//! parachain forks before a winner is determined.
//!
//! We accept parachain forks only if the fork selection rule allows for it. In other words, if we
//! have a backed candidate, we begin seconding/validating a fork only if it has a lower candidate
//! hash. Once both forks are backed, we discard the one with the higher candidate hash.
//! We assume all validators pick the same fork according to the fork selection rule. If we decided
//! to not accept parachain forks, candidates could end up getting only half of the backing votes or
//! even less (for forks of larger arity). This would affect the validator rewards. Still, we don't
//! guarantee that a fork-producing parachain will be able to fully use elastic scaling.
//!
//! Once a candidate is backed and becomes part of the chain, we trim from the unconnected storage
//! any candidates that constitute forks on the chain and no longer have potential.
//!
//! This module also makes use of types provided by the Inclusion Emulator module, such as
//! [`Fragment`] and [`Constraints`]. These perform the actual job of checking for validity of
//! prospective fragments.
//!
//! # Fork choice rule
//!
//! The current rule is: choose the candidate with the lower candidate hash.
//!
//! # Parachain cycles
//!
//! Parachains can create cycles, because:
//!   1. There's no requirement that head-data is unique for a parachain. Furthermore, a parachain
//!      is under no obligation to be acyclic, and this is mostly just because it's totally
//!      inefficient to enforce it. Practical use-cases are acyclic, but there is still more than
//!      one way to reach the same head-data.
//!   2. Candidates only refer to their parent by its head-data. This whole issue could be resolved
//!      by having candidates reference their parent by candidate hash.
//!
//! However, dealing with cycles increases complexity during the backing/inclusion process for no
//! practical reason.
//! These cycles may be accepted by fragment chains while candidates are part of the unconnected
//! storage, but they will definitely not make it to the chain.
//!
//! On the other hand, enforcing that a parachain will NEVER be acyclic would be very complicated
//! (looping through the entire parachain's history on every new candidate or changing the candidate
//! receipt to reference the parent's candidate hash).
//!
//! Therefore, we don't provide a guarantee that a cycle-producing parachain will work (although in
//! practice they probably will if the cycle length is larger than the number of assigned cores
//! multiplied by two).
//!
//! # Spam protection
//!
//! As long as the supplied number of candidates is bounded, [`FragmentChain`] complexity is
//! bounded. This means that higher-level code needs to be selective about limiting the amount of
//! candidates that are considered.
//!
//! Practically speaking, the collator-protocol will limit the number of fetched collations per
//! core, to the number of claim queue assignments for the paraid on that core.
//! Statement-distribution will not allow more than `scheduler_params.lookahead` seconded candidates
//! at a scheduling parent per each validator in the backing group.
//!
//! The code in this module is not designed for speed or efficiency, but conceptual simplicity.
//! Our assumption is that the amount of candidates and parachains we consider will be reasonably
//! bounded and in practice will not exceed a few thousand at any time. This naive implementation
//! will still perform fairly well under these conditions, despite being somewhat wasteful of
//! memory.
//!
//! Still, the expensive candidate data (CandidateCommitments) are wrapped in an `Arc` and shared
//! across fragment chains of the same para on different active leaves.
