/// This includes elements with affinity and free entries.
///
/// The actual queue is implemented via multiple priority queues. One for each core, for entries
/// which currently have a core affinity and one free queue, with entries without any affinity yet.
///
/// The design aims to have most queue accessess be O(1) or O(log(N)). Absolute worst case is O(N).
/// Importantly this includes all accessess that happen in a single block. Even with 50 cores, the
/// total complexity of all operations in the block should maintain above complexities. In
/// particular O(N) stays O(N), it should never be O(N*cores).
///
/// More concrete rundown on complexity:
///
///  - insert: O(1) for placing an order, O(log(N)) for push backs.
///  - pop_assignment_for_core: O(log(N)), O(N) worst case: Can only happen for one core, next core
///  is already less work.
///  - report_processed & push back: If affinity dropped to 0, then O(N) in the worst case. Again
///  this divides per core.
///
///  Reads still exist, also improved slightly, but worst case we fetch all entries.
