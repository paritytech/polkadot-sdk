//! The parachain on demand assignment module.
//!
//! Implements a mechanism for taking in orders for on-demand parachain (previously parathreads)
//! assignments. This module is not handled by the initializer but is instead instantiated in the
//! `construct_runtime` macro.
//!
//! The module currently limits parallel execution of blocks from the same `ParaId` via
//! a core affinity mechanism. As long as there exists an affinity for a `CoreIndex` for
//! a specific `ParaId`, orders for blockspace for that `ParaId` will only be assigned to
//! that `CoreIndex`.
//!
//! NOTE: Once we have elastic scaling implemented we might want to extend this module to support
//! ignoring core affinity up to a certain extend. This should be opt-in though as the parachain
//! needs to support multiple cores in the same block. If we want to enable a single parachain
//! occupying multiple cores in on-demand, we will likely add a separate order type, where the
//! intent can be made explicit.
