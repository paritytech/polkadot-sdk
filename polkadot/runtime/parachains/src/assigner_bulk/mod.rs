// - Test insertion in the middle, beginning and end: Should fail in all cases but the last.
//   (handled by assign_core_enforces_higher_block_number)
// - Test insertion on empty queue. (Handled by assign_core_works_with_no_prior_schedule)
// - Test overwrite vs insert: Overwrite no longer allowed - should fail with error. (handled using
//   Error::DuplicateInsert, though earlier errors should prevent this error from ever triggering)
