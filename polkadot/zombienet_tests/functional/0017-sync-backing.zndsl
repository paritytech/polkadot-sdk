Description: Test we are producing 12-second parachain blocks if sync backing is configured
Network: ./0017-sync-backing.toml
Creds: config

# Check authority status.
alice: reports node_roles is 4

# Ensure parachains are registered.
alice: parachain 2000 is registered within 60 seconds
alice: parachain 2001 is registered within 60 seconds

# Ensure parachains made progress.
alice: reports substrate_block_height{status="finalized"} is at least 10 within 100 seconds

# This parachains should produce blocks at 12s clip, let's assume an 14s rate, allowing for
# some slots to be missed on slower machines
alice: parachain 2000 block height is at least 21 within 300 seconds
alice: parachain 2000 block height is lower than 25 within 2 seconds

# This should already have produced the needed blocks
alice: parachain 2001 block height is at least 21 within 10 seconds
alice: parachain 2001 block height is lower than 25 within 2 seconds
