//! # Foreign Assets and Asset Conversion Example
//!
//! This example shows how to configure a parachain (namely the Asset Para) to be able to have other
//! parachains register their native token as foreign assets, and how the other chains actually
//! register their token. Additionally, the example shows how we can create asset conversion pools
//! to trade foreign assets to the Asset Para's native token, and how this setup can be used to pay
//! XCM-execution fees in a foreign asset.
//!
//! The first step is using the [`pallet_assets::Config`] to create an `ForeignAssets` pallet
//! instance that allows sibling parachains to create their native token on our Asset Para.
#![doc = docify::embed!(
    "src/cookbook/foreign_assets_and_asset_conversion/asset_para/assets.rs",
    foreign_assets
)]
//! As the second step, we will configure the `AssetConvertion` pallet, which will create, and
//! manage liquidity pools for asset swaps. To achieve this, we must add another `pallet_assets`
//! instance, which will be used to manage a liquidity pool's token.
#![doc = docify::embed!(
    "src/cookbook/foreign_assets_and_asset_conversion/asset_para/assets.rs",

)]
//! Finally, in the test we show how the flow to create and use a foreign asset would look like, and
//! what events would be emitted by the chain.
