## Failures
The test specifiers seen in this section have the format 'path::case_idx::compilation_mode'          and they're compatible with the revive differential tests framework and can be specified          to it directly in the same way that they're provided through the `--test` argument of the          framework.

The failures are provided in an expandable section to ensure that the PR does not get         polluted with information. Please click on the section below for more information
