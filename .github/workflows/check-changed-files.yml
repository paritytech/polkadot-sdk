# Reusable workflow to perform checks and generate conditions for other workflows.
# Currently it checks if any Rust (build-related) file is changed
# and if the current (caller) workflow file is changed.
# Example:
#
# jobs:
#   changes:
#     permissions:
#       pull-requests: read
#     uses: ./.github/workflows/check-changed-files.yml
#   some-job:
#     needs: changes
#     if: ${{ needs.changes.outputs.rust }}
#  .......
