name: Check the getting-started.sh script

# This workflow aims to make sure that the `getting-started.sh` script
# is functional and allows to build the templates
# on different operating systems.
#
# There are two jobs inside.
# One for systems that can run in a docker container, and one for macOS.
#
# Each job consists of:
# 1. Some necessary prerequisites for the workflow itself.
# 2. A first pass of the script, which will install dependencies and clone a template.
# 3. A second pass of the script, to make sure the behaviour is as expected.
# 4. Building the template - making sure it's buildable and runnable.
#
# The script is interacted with using the `expect` tool, which is available on all relevant systems.
# The steps are not re-used between macOS and other systems,
# because they are very similar but a little different.
# Additionally, macOS does NOT start from scratch here - for example, we have homebrew already installed.
#
# There are many combinations of systems, shells and templates.
# We test a selected handful of combinations here.
