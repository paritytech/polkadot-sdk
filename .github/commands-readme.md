# Running commands

Command bot has been migrated, it is no longer a comment parser and now it is a GitHub action that works as a [`workflow_dispatch`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch) event.

## How to run an action

To run an action, you need to go to the [_actions tab_](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/actions) and pick the one you desire to run.

The current available command actions are:

- [Command FMT](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/actions/workflows/command-fmt.yml)
- [Command Update UI](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/actions/workflows/command-update-ui.yml)
- [Command Bench](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/actions/workflows/command-bench.yml)
- [Command Bench All](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/actions/workflows/command-bench-all.yml)
- [Command Bench Overhead](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/actions/workflows/command-bench-overhead.yml)

You need to select the action, and click on the dropdown that says: `Run workflow`. It is located in the upper right.

If this dropdown is not visible, you may not have permission to run the action. Contact IT for help.

Each command will have the same two required values, but it could have more.

### Number of the Pull Request

The number of the pull request. Required so the action can fetch the correct branch and comment if it fails.

## How to modify an action

If you want to modify an action and test it, you can do by simply pushing your changes and then selecting your branch in the `Use worflow from` option.

This will use a file from a specified branch.
