> NOTE: We have recently made significant changes to our repository structure. In order to streamline our development
process and foster better contributions, we have merged three separate repositories Cumulus, Substrate and Polkadot into
this repository. Read more about the changes [

# Polkadot SDK

The Polkadot SDK repository provides all the resources needed to start building on the Polkadot network, a multi-chain
blockchain platform that enables different blockchains to interoperate and share information in a secure and scalable
way. The Polkadot SDK comprises three main pieces of software:

## [Polkadot](./polkadot/)
[![PolkadotForum](https://img.shields.io/badge/Polkadot_Forum-e6007a?logo=polkadot)](https://forum.polkadot.network/)
[![Polkadot-license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL3-blue)](./polkadot/LICENSE)

Implementation of a node for the https://polkadot.network in Rust, using the Substrate framework. This directory
currently contains runtimes for the Polkadot, Kusama, Westend, and Rococo networks. In the future, these will be
relocated to the [`runtimes`](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/) repository.

## [Substrate](./substrate/)
 [![SubstrateRustDocs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust_Docs-Substrate-24CC85?logo=rust)](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/substrate/index.html)
 [![Substrate-license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL3%2FApache2.0-blue)](./substrate/README.md#LICENSE)

Substrate is the primary blockchain SDK used by developers to create the parachains that make up the Polkadot network.
Additionally, it allows for the development of self-sovereign blockchains that operate completely independently of
Polkadot.

## [Cumulus](./cumulus/)
[![CumulusRustDocs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust_Docs-Cumulus-222222?logo=rust)](https://paritytech.github.io/cumulus/cumulus_client_collator/index.html)
[![Cumulus-license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL3-blue)](./cumulus/LICENSE)

Cumulus is a set of tools for writing Substrate-based Polkadot parachains.
