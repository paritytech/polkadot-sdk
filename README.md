## üöÄ Releases

> [!NOTE]
> Our release process is still Work-In-Progress and may not yet reflect the aspired outline
> here.

The Polkadot-SDK has two release channels: `stable` and `nightly`. Production software is advised to
only use `stable`. `nightly` is meant for tinkerers to try out the latest features. The detailed
release process is described in [RELEASE.md](docs/RELEASE.md).

### üòå Stable

`stable` releases have a support duration of **three months**. In this period, the release will not
have any breaking changes. It will receive bug fixes, security fixes, performance fixes and new
non-breaking features on a **two week** cadence.

### ü§† Nightly

`nightly` releases are released every night from the `master` branch, potentially with breaking
changes. They have pre-release version numbers in the format `major.0.0-nightlyYYMMDD`.

## üîê Security

The security policy and procedures can be found in
[docs/contributor/SECURITY.md](./docs/contributor/SECURITY.md).

## Polkadot Fellowship

Development in this repo usually goes hand in hand with the `fellowship` organization. In short,
this repository provides all the SDK pieces needed to build both Polkadot and its parachains. But,
the actual Polkadot runtime lives in the `fellowship/runtimes` repository. Read more about the
fellowship, this separation, the RFC process
[here](https://polkadot-fellows.github.io/dashboard/).

## History

This repository is the amalgamation of 3 separate repositories that used to make up Polkadot SDK,
namely Substrate, Polkadot and Cumulus. Read more about the merge and its history
[here](https://polkadot-public.notion.site/Polkadot-SDK-FAQ-fbc4cecc2c46443fb37b9eeec2f0d85f).
