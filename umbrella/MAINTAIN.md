`polkadot-sdk` should be updated when another crate is added to or removed from the workspace. There
is a CI check to ensure that it is in sync with the
[Polkadot-sdk](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk) workspace.​

All the code in this crate is generated by
[`./scripts/generate-umbrella.py`](../scripts/generate-umbrella.py). We strongly recommend using the
script for updating rather than editing the files manually. Running the script requires
[`toml`](https://pypi.org/project/toml/) and
[`cargo-workspace>=2.2.6`](https://pypi.org/project/cargo-workspace/).​ ​
```shell​
python3 ./scripts/generate-umbrella.py --sdk . --version 0.1.0​
```
